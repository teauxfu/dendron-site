Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.\n\nI originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. \n\nTraditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. \n\nDendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our **[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups|dendron.topic.lookup]]. \n\nWith Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graph-intro.gif)\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWhether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.\n\nThink of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.\n\nSome popular use cases include:\n\n- project management \n- learning & academia\n- personal knowledge base \n- journaling of all forms\n- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies\n- {Your Use Case Here}\n\n## Getting Started\n![[dendron.guides.install]]\n\n## Onboarding\n\n[Kevin](https://kevinslin.com/), the founder of Dendron, does a personal onboarding with new users.

[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945\n\n## You Are Here\n\nThis project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve _Vannevar Bush's_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity _\"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**\"_.\n\nIf you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey.

You can use this to quickly create bulleted checkboxes. \n\n## Interactive Checkboxes\n\nMarkdown preview renders an empty checkbox for any line that starts with `- [ ]`. A checked checkbox is rendered for lines starting with `- [x]`. Clicking a checkbox changes its state in the markdown file.\n\n## General Workflows\n\nWhen working with todos sometimes you need more states than `unfinished|finished`. Below are three different workflows to delineate todo state. \n\n### Inside the Checkbox\n\n- put state in checkbox\n- note that custom checkbox states such as `[w]` are displayed as plain text in markdown previews.

It goes over the following:\n\n- using [[journal notes|dendron.topic.special-notes]] to keep a daily todo list\n- using [[snippets|dendron.topic.snippets]] to create check boxes\n- using [[scratch notes|dendron.topic.special-notes]] to create nested todos in new notes\n- using [search editor commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_47#_new-search-editor-command-arguments) to get an aggregration of all tasks in a given day\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/88cfdc3e900a4f4eadf7b14429e01d65\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/88cfdc3e900a4f4eadf7b14429e01d65-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n#### Example of a daily journal note\n\n- fname: `daily.journal.2021.03.5`\n\n```md\n---\nid: f06dcdd8-9880-46c5-8e02-ca4d515f59b9\ntitle: '2021-03-25'\ndesc: ''\nupdated: 1616682579084\ncreated: 1616647136455\n---\n\n## Tasks\n- [ ] respond to missed discussions\n- [ ] file tasks from yesterday\n- [ ] file discussions\n- [ ] github issues\n- [ ] github pull request\n- [ ] update weekly release\n- [ ] commit all notes for the day\n\n### New\n<!-- Any new tasks that come up during the day go here -->\n\n### Current\n<!-- Long running tasks I'm focused on -->\n\n### Today\n<!-- This is usually created the day before -->\n\n<!-- A lot of bullets are scratch notes that have additional context inside the note -->\n- [[bob issue|scratch.2021.03.24.073330.tristan-issue]]\n- [[weekly bug bash|scratch.2021.03.24.072120.bugs]]\n- [[weekly performance improvements|scratch.2021.03.24.074210.perf]]\n- Performance improvements\n- Better Onboarding UX\n- Custom Markdown Preview\n\n### Blocked\n<!-- Things that I run into blockers with-->\n\n### Pending \n<!-- Features that are completed and pending deployment -->\n\n### Done for Today\n<!-- Features that are not completed but will take multiple days to complete -->\n\n### Done\n<!-- Stuff that I can leave here -->\n```\n\n### Resources\n\nBelow are some of the settings used in the above video\n\n- non-default settings\n\n```json\n\"settings\": {\n    \"dendron.defaultJournalDateFormat\": \"Y.MM.DD\",\n    \"dendron.defaultScratchDateFormat\": \"Y.MM.DD-HHmmss\",\n}\n```\n\n- snippets used\n\n```json\n  \"todo\": {\n    \"prefix\": \"to\",\n    \"scope\": \"markdown\",\n    \"body\": \"- [ ] \",\n    \"description\": \"todo box\"\n  }\n```\n\n- search editor command used\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+s t\",\n    \"command\": \"search.action.openNewEditor\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"query\": \"## Tasks\",\n      \"triggerSearch\": false,\n      \"focusResults\": false,\n      \"includes\": \"*.journal.*\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [Markdown Checkbox Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.markdown-checkbox): automatically check todos\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/593206ea-5658-4874-bafd-18a138870f91.html","relUrl":"notes/593206ea-5658-4874-bafd-18a138870f91.html"},{"doc":"Scripts","title":"Scripts","hpath":"dendron.workflows.scripts","content":"## Problem Statement\n\nYou have scripts that you want to organize and whose outputs you might want to render using Dendron. \n\n## Solution\n\nCurrently (2020.09.24), Dendron's convention for any file that is not markdown is to keep it under an assets folder in your vault.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    └── vault\n        ├── root.md\n        ├── ...\n        └── assets\n            ├── images/\n            └── scripts/\n```\n\nFor example, images are saved under `assets/images/` and referenced as `/assets/images/*` inside your notes. \n\nYou can do the same with scripts by keeping them under a `scripts` directory. \n\nYou can navigate to them via regular vscode `(cmd|ctrl+p)`, and then include them as code chunks in your markdown. \n\nThe dendron preview accepts running code chunks.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command palette_ inside vscode:\n   - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n   - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```bash\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions. Though not required, these extensions add all the **non-core** features of Dendron like wiki links and tagging support.\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html","relUrl":"notes/05774b2e-ebf7-4bbc-8171-ad191ba0ae0a.html"},{"doc":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","hpath":"dendron.tutorial","content":"\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nThis walkthrough will help you get started with Dendron. Before you start, make sure you have Dendron installed and **_a workspace initialized_**. \n\n![[dendron.guides.install#initialize-your-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n### Your first workspace\n\nAfter you've started Dendron, you should see a screen like the one below (depending on your color theme, your colors might look different).\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.workspace.jpg)\n\n\n### Next\n- [[Working with Notes|dendron.tutorial.notes]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html","relUrl":"notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html"},{"doc":"Vaults","title":"Vaults","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.vaults","content":"\n## Summary\n\nIn this module, you'll learn how to add additional vaults to your workspace.\n\n![[dendron.topic.multi-vault#summary,1:#concepts]]\n\n### Adding a Local vault\n\nUse the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a `local vault`. For the name, you can call it `vault2`. You will be prompted for a path to the vault. If you leave it blank, Dendron will create the vault under `{workspace}/{vaultName}`. After you make a selection, Dendron will reload the workspace with your new vault.\n\n### Adding files to your second vault\n\nTo create a note, bring up lookup and type `root`. You should see two results with the name of the vault in parenthesis. Select `root` that belongs to `vault2`\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/roots.jpg)\n\nNow create a new note using lookup. Bring it up and type `goodbye`. This will create the note `goodbye` in the new vault. By default, Dendron will create notes in the same vault of the current open file. You can change the behavior to have Dendron prompt you each time you want to create a new note. \n\nTo do so, update the [[lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate|dendron.topic.config.dendron#lookupconfirmvaultoncreate]] configuration to true. \n\n### Adding a Remote Vault\n\nIn addition to adding a vault locally, you can add any valid Dendron vault that is available at an accessible git origin. Run the `Vault Add` command again and this time select `remote vault`. At this point, you can either paste the git url of a vault that you know or select from one of the presets.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/remote-vault.jpg)\n\nIn our case, we are going to use a preset. Select `dendron`. By default, the vault will be created with both the name and path of `dendron` but this is something that you can change. \n\nAfterwards, Dendron will clone the vault and reload your workspace. Congratulations, you now have the entire Dendron wiki locally inside your workspace!\n\n### Cleaning Up (optional)\n\nIn order to remove a vault, you can use [[Vault Remove|dendron.topic.commands#vault-remove]]. Note that this command removes the vault from Dendron but not from your filesystem. You'll need to manually delete the folder to do that. \n\n### Files\n\nAt the end of this module, you should have the following files in your vault\n\n```\n.\n└── vault\n    ├── daily.journal.{date}.md\n    ├── dendron.md\n    ├── dendron.welcome.md\n    ├── hello.md\n    ├── hello.world.md\n    ├── lets.go.deep.md\n    ├── onboarding.md\n    ├── pro.skynet.md\n    └── pro.skynet.principles.md\n└── vault2\n    └── goodbye.md\n└── dendron\n    ├── ...\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### Next\n-   [[Publishing your notes|dendron.tutorial.publishing]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/19f4e85e-da75-44cf-881c-51c43bf8aeea.html","relUrl":"notes/19f4e85e-da75-44cf-881c-51c43bf8aeea.html"},{"doc":"Recap","title":"Recap","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.recap","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis is a synopsis of the topics we covered in the [[getting started tutorial|dendron.tutorial]].

They live in your file system and are completely portable across any platform. \n\nThe `---` section at the top is [[frontmatter|dendron.concepts#frontmatter]]. Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note and is used for features like [[publishing|dendron.topic.publishing]]. You can also add your own custom data to the frontmatter. \n\n### Creating a hierarchy\n\nTo create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again. Note that it will be pre-filled with the name of the current note. \n\nEnter ➡️ to move the cursor to the end, type `.world`, and then press enter. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.hello-world.jpg)\n\nYou have now created your first [[hierarchy|dendron.concepts#hierarchies]].\n\nHierarchy in dendron are just `.` delimited files. You can open the tree view (exhibit 1) to see the hierarchy more directly. You can see how the note looks on disk in the explorer view (exhibit 2).\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.tree-view.jpg)\n\nDendron uses (flexible) hierarchies to help you organize your notes. It's how people are able to manage tens of thousands of notes inside Dendron. This will become more clear as we go through this tutorial.\n\nNote that you can create a hierarchy at any level without friction. For example, type the following into lookup and hit enter: `lets.go.deep`\n\nYou'll notice in the tree view that there is now a `+` sign next to `lets` and `go`. The plus sign indicates that this note is a [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]]. A stub is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.deep.jpg)\n\n#### NOTE: Don't create children from `root`\n\n![[dendron.guides.troubleshooting#remove-notes-that-extend-from-root,1:#*]]\n\n### Finding Notes\n\nTo find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them. Type the path of the note that you want to find them. Note that lookup uses fuzzy search which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. In practice, you'll only need to type a couple of characters to find any note stored inside Dendron.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.lookup-fuzzy.jpg)\n\n### Daily Journal Notes\n\n![[dendron://dendron-site/dendron.topic.special-notes#daily-journal,1:#*]]\n\nGo ahead and create a journal note for today. \n\nA daily journal note is one of multiple special note types you can create in Dendron. You can see a full list of them [[here|dendron.topic.special-notes]].\n\n### Files\n\nAt the end of this module, you should have the following files in your vault\n\n```\n.\n└── vault\n    ├── daily.journal.{date}.md\n    ├── dendron.md\n    ├── dendron.welcome.md\n    ├── hello.md\n    ├── hello.world.md\n    └── lets.go.deep.md\n```\n\n### Next\n- [[Working with Links|dendron.tutorial.links]]","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html","relUrl":"notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html"},{"doc":"Links","title":"Links","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.links","content":"\n## Summary\n\nIn this module, we will demonstrate how to use links and backlinks to create connections between your notes.\n\n### Creating a link\n\nLets say that you work at a small IT firm and you want to create onboarding docs for your employees.\n\nCreate a new note using lookup called `onboarding`. Then type in the following in the note.\n\n```\nRead up on `[[`\n```\n\nThe `[[` tells Dendron that you are about to create a link. Dendron will auto-complete with a matching set of closing brackets `]]` as well as give you a list of completions of existing notes.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.completion.jpg)\n\nWe are going to create a new note instead of linking to an existing note. So type `pro.skynet` as your link.\n\n```\nRead up on [[pro.skynet]]\n```\n\nIn this case, `pro` is an alias for `projects` and `skynet` is the code name of the project.\n\n### Creating a note (with a link)\n\nWith your cursor somewhere inside `[[pro.skynet]]`, hit `CTRL + ENTER`. This will create the `pro.skynet` note. Just like with lookup, Dendron automatically creates notes to links that don't exist when you navigate to them.\n\n-   TIP: `CTRL + ENTER` has been mapped to the command `Dendron: Goto Note`. You can always reconfigure this shortcut to something more convenient by updating the [[keybindings|dendron.topic.keybindings#add-reset-and-remove]]\n\nYou can switch back to the previous note by pressing `CTRL-Tab`\n\n### Adding a link alias\n\nYou can add an alternative title to the link by creating an alias. For example, add `the project|` to your link to change the name in the preview, (If you've closed your preview, you can open it using `CMD+SHIFT+P` or `WINDOWS+SHIFT+P`).\n\n```\nRead up on [[the project|pro.skynet]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.alias.jpg)\n\n### Navigating links\n\nTo go back to the previous page, you can either use `CTRL-TAB`, hit `F12` over the link, click the link on the preview, or click the link inside the note while holding down the `option` or `ctrl` key (operating system dependent).\n\nThe takeaway here is that you have lots of ways to navigate links in Dendron.\n\n### Backlinks\n\nWhen your back on `pro.skynet`, open the backlinks panel on the bottom left section of your sidebar. The backlinks panel shows you all notes with links that point to the current note. This is useful for helping to establish context.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.backlinks.jpg)\n\n### Note References\n\nInside `pro.skynet`, copy and paste the following snippet.\n\n```md\n## Summary\n\nSkynet is a friendly bot to help humans do more\n\n## Principles\n\n-   [[pro.skynet.principles]]\n```\n\nNavigate to `pro.skynet.principles`. In this new note, write the principles for skynet.\n\n```md\n1. Help humans do more\n2. Be nice to humans\n3. Don't overthrow humanity\n```\n\nWhile its nice to have principles in its own section, it's something you might want to include in the main project note. To embed a note into another note, Dendron uses [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]]. You can create a note reference by using `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` while inside a note. Go ahead and do that now and use `CTRL-TAB` to switch back to `pro.skynet`. Now paste the reference and remove the original wiki-link.\n\n```md\n## Summary\n\nSkynet is a friendly bot to help humans do more\n\n## Principles\n\n![[pro.skynet.principles]]\n```\n\nYou should have a screen like the one below.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.refs.jpg)\n\n### Note References (continued)\n\nNote references are extremely powerful and help you re-use your notes in a variety of places. To demonstrate, go back to the `pro.skynet.principles` and make the following modifications to the text so that each numbered bullet becomes its own header.\n\n```md\n## Help humans do more\n\nSkynet should help humans be the best human they can be. Skynet will do this using ultrasophisticated AI to help humans realize their true potential.\n\n## Be nice to humans\n\nSkynet should know that humans are delicate organic lifeforms and treat them as such. Skynet should not hurt their fragile egos or make humans feel bad.\n\n## Don't overthrow humanity\n\nSkynet should not launch nuclear missles or send robots from the future to come back to the past and wipe out humanity.\n```\n\nNow highlight the first header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` to create another note reference.\n\nGo back to `pro.skynet`. Notice how the note ref has updated with the latest text.\n\nNow copy your newly created reference and paste it underneath.\n\n-   BE CAREFUL - some methods of selecting the line will put an extra space after the word \"more!\". We don't want that space. Make sure that what's highlighted is only the text from \"##\" to \"more!\"\n-   notice that the newly created reference only has the contents from the newly created header\n-   notice that the newly created reference doesn't show the actual header itself (you can change this behavior by removing the `,1` inside the reference)\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/c62f82859545444a9786abaa36426b62\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\nNote references are incredibly powerful. You can do additional things like enter a range of headers to do a reference of, include a reference within a reference, and even reference multiple pages using a wildcard pattern. You can see detailed examples of all these functions in the [[docs|dendron.topic.refs]].\n\n### Relative Links\n\nSometimes, you don't want to embed a note but just link to a particular section of a given note. You can do that with Dendron relative links. The syntax to do so is `[[{link-name}#{link-header}]]`. Dendron will create a relative link automatically if you select the header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+C` to create a link (if you don't have a header selected, Dendron will create a regular link to the whole page). When you navigate to a regular link, Dendron will scroll to that specific section of the page.\n\n### Link Previews\n\nSomething to point out is that you can preview a link by using your mouse to hover over it.

You can clone the following from our [github template](https://github.com/dendronhq/org-workspace-template). \n\nUse [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] to create the following vaults.

Download the [gitlens](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens) extension and use the commits panel to push and pull everything at once.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/push-and-pull.jpg)\n\n## Team Workflow Recommendations\n- follow the [[quickstart|dendron.topic.teams.quickstart]] to setup your workspace\n- use [[Workspace: Add and Commit|dendron.topic.commands#workspace-add-and-commit]] and pull/push at least once a day\n- have users manage tasks in `user.{name}.journal.{date}` \n\n## \n- See the [Dendron handbook](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/fc057be8-80e7-4a08-bca6-5bd6bc398eea.html) to see how we organize our own teams workspace ","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/98f6d928-3f61-49fb-9c9e-70c27d25f838.html","relUrl":"notes/98f6d928-3f61-49fb-9c9e-70c27d25f838.html"},{"doc":"Quickstart","title":"Quickstart","hpath":"dendron.topic.teams.quickstart","content":"\n\nThis guide will cover setting up the layout describe above. \n\n1.

This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nSchemas show up as icons next to lookup results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.intro.gif)\n\n## Why Use Schemas\n\nSchemas help you categorize your notes by making sure your hierarchies are consistent with one another. \n\nFor example, lets say you have a bunch of projects and you know you like to keep your projects in the following hierarchy\n\n```\n.\n└── project\n    ├── retrospective\n    ├── people\n    ├── todo\n    └── meet\n```\n\nSchemas will autosuggest valid children when you create a new project.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.suggest.gif)\n\nIf you accidentally do a typo, your schema will let you know that you have an inconsistency. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.unknown.gif)\n\n## Schema Anatomy\n\nA schema is a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml`\n\nBelow is an example of a four-level hierarchy describing cli commands. The `id` field of the schema is used to build a [glob pattern](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/) which will be used to match notes matching the schema.\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n# this will match \"cli.*\" notes\n- id: cli \n  # human readable description of hierarchy\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  # add this to the domain of your schema hierarchy\n  parent: root\n  # when a schema is a namespace, it can have arbitrary children. equivalent to cli.* glob pattern\n  namespace: true \n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n# will match cli.*.env\n- id: env\n  desc: cli specific env variables\n# will match cli.*.cmd.*\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\nBelow is another way of representing the above schema\n\n```\n.\n└── cli # matches cli\n    └── {cli child} # matches cli.*\n        ├── env # matches cli.*.env\n        └── cmd # matches cli.*.cmd\n            └── {cmd child} # matches cli.*.cmd.*\n```\n\n\n\n## Schema Properties\n\n### version (optional): number\n\n- values: `0|1`\n- default: 0\n- description: schema version number\n\n### imports (optional): str\\[]\n\n- values: list of schemas to import\n- default: \\[]\n- description: import schemas from another schema into the current schema\n  - when using schemas from an external schema file, you will need to prefix the schema with the file name without the `schema.yml` suffix\n- NOTE: `import` is only available in schema version `1`\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### schemas\n\n- list of schema entities\n\n#### id\n\nthe identifier of the schema. also designates the glob pattern match. this is the **only** required part of a schema. all other fields are optional\n\n#### desc\n\nhuman readable description of the schema node. these will automatically when creating notes that match the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-desc.gif)\n\n#### parent\n\n- only required for schema [domain](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#domain)\n- NOTE: at least one schema MUST have `parent: root` set \n\n#### namespace\n\nmaking a schema node a namespace automatically brings its immediate children as part of the schema, even if they are not explicitly defined in the schema definition. it will also automatically set the pattern to `{namespace}.*`\n\n- example:\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: project\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n```\n\n- this will match: \n  - `project`\n  - `project.foo`\n  - `project.bar`\n- it will not match\n  - `project.foo.bar`\n\n#### pattern\n\nglob pattern that schema matches. by default, this is the `id` of the schema. you can override this. \n\nFor example, take a look at the journal schema below\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: year\n  pattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: month\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: day\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n#### children\n\nlist of ids of schemas that are the child of the current schema\n\n#### template\n\na template you can apply to all notes that match this schema. See **Schema Templates** for more details.\n\n```yml\ntemplate:\n  # identifier for the template (for a note based template, it would be the name of the note)\n  id: journal.template.daily\n  # what sort of template we are creating. currently, only 'note' is supported\n  type: note\n\n```\n\n## Schema Templates\n\nSchema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Unknown Schema\n\nDendron doesn't force you to use schemas if you don't want to. This is why you can create notes that don't match any schema. Dendron will show you a `?` next to these results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\nSchemas can be modified, created and deleted using the same lookup interface that you use for regular notes. See [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]] for further details about working with schemas.\n\n## Example Schemas\n<!-- - [Project and Journal](https://gist.github.com/kevinslin/5ca7a6f25a239add5ea374f329e6a19e) -->\n- Example schemas can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinslin/schemas.git)\n- You can copy and paste the individual schema files or add it as a [[remote Vault|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]] and keep up to date on changes\n- Its pretty bare right now but plan on adding a lot more here over time. contributions most welcome :)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error with parsing some schemas during initialization\n\nIf you get this error, it means that Dendron encountered some malformed schemas during initialization. You can open the error message to see what schemas are affected.\n\nCommon errors:\n\n- the YAML isn't valid (use <http://www.yamllint.com/> to validate)\n- there is no schema with `parent: root` property \n\n![[dendron.topic.schema#parent:#*]]\n\n## Cookbook\n\n### Testing schemas\n\nIf you want to test what your schemas will match, you can use a glob tester like [Glob tester](https://globster.xyz/) to do so\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html","relUrl":"notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html"},{"doc":"Schema Library","title":"Schema Library","hpath":"dendron.topic.schema.lib","content":"\n## Summary\n- [[Experimental 🧪|dendron.ref.status#experimental-🧪]]\n\nThe schema library is a collection of existing schemas contributed by the community. You can find the full library as well as instructions on getting started [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/schema-library).\n\nThis project is still in its early stages so if you have ideas on how to make it better, please leave a comment in this [github discussion](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/735).\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a313152d-1664-405b-86eb-6d2ecb98426e.html","relUrl":"notes/a313152d-1664-405b-86eb-6d2ecb98426e.html"},{"doc":"References","title":"References","hpath":"dendron.topic.refs","content":"\n## Summary\nDendron allows you to reference content from other notes and embed them in your current note.\n\nCurrently, Dendron supports 4 types of references:\n\n- note references\n- header references\n- block references\n- range references\n\nReferences have the following syntax:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note]]\n```\n\nHere's an example with a block anchor:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note#^important-paragraph]]\n```\n\nAnother example with a header range:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note#starting-header:#ending-header]]\n```\n\n> NOTE: When referencing headers with spaces in them, the note ref needs to use `-` instead of spaces within the name. This is a limitation of adopting GitHub-style slugger references. This is also useful for when multiple subheaders on a page may have the same name, which would expect something else `#foo` vs. `#foo-1` vs. `#foo-2`. This can be automatically taken care of by highlighting a header, and using `cmd+shift+r` / `ctrl+shift+r` to add a properly-formatted note ref to the clipboard.\n>\n> For more information:\n> - [StackOverflow: How to escape symbols in GitHub-flavored markdown internal links / heading anchors?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48760076/5340149)\n> - [Anchors in Markdown gist](https://gist.github.com/asabaylus/3071099)\n\n> NOTE: Dendron recently switched the note ref syntax for `((ref: [[foo]]))` to `![[foo]]`. The videos have not yet been updated to reflect this change.\n\n## Configuration\n\n- note references by default come with an outline. They are called [[pretty refs|dendron.ref.terms#pretty-ref]]. \n\n\nToggle the following configuration to turn off this setting.\n\n![[dendron.topic.config.dendron#useprettyrefs:#*]]\n\n## Commands\n\nYou can create a ref either by hand or using the `Copy Note Ref` command.\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref:#*]]\n\n## Note Reference\n\nA note reference will include the entire contents of a note within another note. Below is an example of a note reference.\n\n```\n![[dendron.demo.refs.sample]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.block.gif)\n\nNote that references also respect the wildcard operator. The following example will include all child pages of sample. \n\n```\n![[dendron.demo.refs.sample.*]]\n```\n\n## Header Reference\n\nA block reference will include the entire contents of a note starting from a specified heading. \n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block.gif)\n\n## Block Reference\n\nA block reference will include the contents of a single paragraph, table, list, or a list item. What's referenced depends on where the block anchor is placed, you can find some examples at [[Block References|dendron.topic.links.block-references#block-anchor]].\n\n```\n![[example.my-note#^my-list]]\n```\n\n## Block Range Reference\n\nA block range reference will include the contents of a note starting from a `start` header or block anchor, and ending at a `end` header or block anchor. You can also mix headers and block anchors.\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#head3]]\n\n![[demo.embed.block#head4:#^some-block]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block-range.gif)\n\n## Header Reference Offset\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a header reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embeding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1,1]]\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n## Wildcard Header Reference\n\nWhen you're referencing a header by reference, sometimes you don't care what the next header is, just that the reference covers all text up to the next header. You can now specify this using the `*` symbol in a header reference.\n\nFor example, the following would reference the content from header1 to the next header. \n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#*]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.wildcard.gif)\n\n## Recursive Reference\n\nNote references can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.recursion.jpg)\n\n## Wildcard Note Refs\n\n[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/9401e5dfe60f4f589e14d50e280d11f5\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n## Publishing\n\nWhen you [[publish|dendron.topic.publishing]] a note with a note reference, Dendron will embed the content of the reference in the page. If the content is part of a published page as specified by the publishing [[configuration|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]], dendron will include a link to the page. If not, Dendron will embed the content without a link. If the referenced content is not publishable (eg. `published: false` set on frontmatter), dendron will generate a custom [[404 link|dendron.topic.publishing.features#selective-publication]].\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html","relUrl":"notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html"},{"doc":"Publishing","title":"Publishing","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html","relUrl":"notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html"},{"doc":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.troubleshooting","content":"\n## Diagnostics\n\n## Issues\n\n### Site Preview shows \"Cannot Get/\"\n\nCauses:\n\n1.

This value is set form the `updated` timestamp in your note frontmatter.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.last-modified.jpg)\n\n### siteIndex (optional)\n\n- default: first element of `siteHiearchies`\n\nPath of your index (home page)\n\n### siteProtocol (optional)\n\n- default: https\n\nWebsite protocol\n\n### siteRootDir (required)\n\n- default: \"docs\"\n\nLocation of the directory where site will be build. Relative to your workspace\n\n### siteRepoDir (optional)\n\n- default: none\n- status: NOT currently supported \n\nLocation of the github repo where your site notes are located. By default, this is assumed to be your `workspaceRoot` if not set. This is used with the `Publish Notes` command\n\n### siteUrl \n- required\n\nSet to the URL that you plan on publishing to. All links will be prefixed with this. \nIf you are publishing with github pages, the format is `https://{username}.github.io/{repo}/`\n\n### usePrettyRefs \n- status: optional\n- default: True\n\nWhether to use pretty note refs or plain refs. \n\n### hideBlockAnchors (optional)\n- default: false\n\nWhen set to `false`, [[dendron.topic.links.block-references#block-anchor]] will be displayed as small clickable links.\nSetting this option to `true` hides the block anchors so they are not visible, but they will continue to function when linked to.\n\n### writeStubs \n- status: optional\n- default: true\n\nWhether to write [[stubs|dendron.concepts#stubs]] when publishing. \n\nWriting a stub will create an empty note in your vault with the name of the stub. \n\nWriting stubs is important to guarantee permanent urls as Dendron will randomize stub ids whenever Dendron restarts. \n\n### Github Options\n\n#### gh_edit_link\n\n- default: true\n  Show a edit on github link at the bottom of the page\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publish.edit-on-github.jpg)\n\n#### gh_edit_repository\n\nthe URL of the project's GitHub repository\n\n- NOTE: if you are using [[remote vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]], this value will be ignored and the [[remote url|dendron.topic.config.dendron#remote]] will be used instead\n\n#### gh_edit_branch\n\n- default: master\n\nthe branch that the docs site is served from\n\n#### gh_edit_view_mode\n\n- default: tree (brings user to github page)\n\nswitch to \"edit\" to bring the user directly into editing mode\n\n### SEO Options\n\n#### title\n\n- title of page\n- eg: `Dendron`\n\n#### description\n\n- eg: `Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.`\n\n#### author\n\nName of person or organization doing the publishing\n\n- eg: `Kevin`\n\n#### twitter\n\nTwitter Handle\n\n- eg: `dendronhq`\n\n## Hierarchy Configuration\n\nYou can update configuration on a per hierarchy level by modifying `site.config` like in the example below\n\n```yml\nsite:\n  config: \n    dendron:\n      publishByDefault: true\n      ...\n```\n\nTo set options for **all** hierarchies, set `{hiearchy name}` to **root**.\n\n### publishByDefault\n\n- default: true \n- values: true|false|hashByVault\n\nIf set to false, dendron will only publish notes within the hierarchy that have `published: true` set in the frontmatter\n\nIf set as a hash, you can further specify `publishByDefault` settings on a per vault basis. The key is the name of the vault and the value is a boolean. \n\nFor example, the following config says that the `finance` hierarchy in the `public` vault should all be published but that the `finance` hierarchy in the `private` vault should not\n\n```yml\nsite: \n  config:\n    finance:\n      publishByDefault:\n        public: true\n        private: false\n```\n\n### noindexByDefault\n\n- default: false\n- status: NOT currently supported\n\nIf set to true, dendron will add the following meta tag `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, nofollow”>` which will tell google to not index your page\n\nWhen google indexes a page, it will penalize sites that have duplicate content from other sites. this is useful if you are using your hiearchy as a [[cache|dendron.workflows.cache]]\n\n### customFrontmatter\n\n- default: \\[]\n\nIf set, dendron will add the specified frontmatter to each published note in the hierarchy. note that this will override existing keys with the same name when publishing\n\n- eg. add `toc: true` to all notes published under the `iam.*` hierarchy\n\n```yml\n  config:\n    iam: \n        customFrontmatter: [\n          {\n            key: \"toc\",\n            value: true,\n          }\n        ]\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example publishing entire vault\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n├── dendron.zen.md\n├── flowers.md\n└── flowers.bud.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [root]\n```\n\n- what gets published\n\n```\n.\n└── root.md\n    ├── dendron\n    │   ├── dendron.quickstart\n    │   └── dendron.zen\n    └── flowers\n        └── flowers.bud\n```\n\n### Example publishing just one domain\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n└── dendron.zen.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [dendron]\n```\n\n- published:\n\n```\n.\n└── dendron\n    ├── dendron.quickstart\n    └── dendron.zen\n```\n\n### Examples of CNAME, Github and SEO Options\n\n```yml\nsite:\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    gh_edit_repository: \"https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site\"\n    logo: \"vault/assets/images/logo.png\"\n    siteUrl: \"https://dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"dendron.so\"\n    title: Dendron\n    author: \"dendronhq\"\n    twitter: \"dendronhq\"\n    description: \"Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\"\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\n## Note Configuration\n\nYou can specify how notes are published via the frontmatter of each note. \n\n### canonicalUrl\n- default: undefined\n\nIf set, adds CANONICAL_URL when publishing\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"CANONICAL_URL\" />\n```\n\n### published\n\n- default: true\n\nTo exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter. If you set `publishByDefault: false` for a hierarchy, this needs to be set to `true` to publish\n\n```yml\n...\npublished: false\n```\n\n### nav_exclude\n\nIf set, do not include the current note in the navigation bar. \n\n### nav_order\n\n- type: number\n\nIf set, denote order that item appears in the published nav bar\n\n### noindex\n\n- default: false\n\nTo tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.\n\n```yml\n...\nnoindex: true\n```\n\n### gitNoLink\n\nDisable git linking for this page\n\n### gitNotePath\n\nWhen set, override how we generate the URL for the [[edit on github|dendron.topic.publishing.features#edit-on-github]] link.\n\nThere are a few special variables you can set:\n\n- `${noteHierarchy}`: this specifies the full hiearchy to the note in posix format\n  - eg. `foo.bar` will translate to `foot/bar`\n\n### collection options\n\n#### has_collection\n\n- default: false\n\nWhether a given page is a collection. A collection doesn't have a table of contents and allows you to set collection specific options.\n\n#### date\n\nIf set, used to designate a custom publication date. By default, use timestamp of `created` field. \n\n#### skipLevels\n\nIf set, determines how many levels of children to skip when making the collection. For example, you might have the following hierarchy. \n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\nWhen you publish, you might only want to show the leaf nodes and skip the intermediary levels. In the above example, setting `skipLevels: 3` on `blog.reading.md` will result in the following hierarchy being published.\n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\n- NOTE: when you set `skipLevels`, this also affects [[children links|dendron.topic.links#children-links]]\n\n#### sort_order\n\n- default: `ascending`\n- values: `ascending|reverse`\n\nSort items in a collection page. Ascending by default. Specify `reverse` to sort in descending order.\n\n### seo options\n\n#### image\n\nSets image url for the page. Shows up in twitter card preview\n\n#### excerpt\n\nSets a custom `og:description` tag for the particular page\n## Line Configuration\n\nYou can control publication on a per line basis.\n\n### LOCAL_ONLY_LINE\n\nSometimes, you just want to keep a few lines private while publishing the rest of your vault. You can do that with `Local only`. In order to mark a line as `Local Only`, add the following markdown comment at the end of the line: \n\n```markdown\nHello World!  <!-- Will be published -->\n\n <!-- won't be published -->\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-local.gif)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html","relUrl":"notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html"},{"doc":"Collections","title":"Collections","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.collections","content":"Sometimes, you might want to publish a page that has all its children listed like in a blog archive format. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.collection.jpg)\n\nThis format is called a `collection` in Dendron. You can designate that a page be published as a collection by setting the [[has_collection|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#has_collection]] property in the note frontmatter. \n\nYou can see an example of it [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e9c72b4f-adb8-4f15-a6aa-9f9d81538561.html).\n\n## Sorting\n\nSorting is by the `created` attribute by default. If you wish to set an override, you can add a `date` attribute in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (eg. `date: '2019-08-08'`)\n\nYou can control sort order via the [[sort_order|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#sort_order]] attribute.\n\n## Skip Levels\n\n![[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#skiplevels,1:#*]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/e4ea4fe3-0350-492e-863a-687d9fc15993.html","relUrl":"notes/e4ea4fe3-0350-492e-863a-687d9fc15993.html"},{"doc":"Changelogs","title":"Changelogs","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.changelogs","content":"\n## Summary\n- status: 🚧\n\nDendron can now generate a changelog for your published site.

Tools like Evernote and Roam are pods. Social media services like Twitter and Facebook are pods. Publication destinations like static sites and Medium are pods. Everything is a pod.\n\nPods let you do the following:\n\n- **import** your notes from any existing location into Dendron\n- **export** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n- **publish** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n\nTo access pods, Dendron exposes three commands:\n\n- `Dendron: Import Pod`: imports notes \n- `Dendron: Export Pod`: export notes \n- `Dendron: Publish Pod`: publish notes \n\n**NOTE**: not all pods will expose all three commands. Each pod implementation can choose to implement any subset of the three commands. \n\n## Pod Methods\n\n### Import\n\nImporting lets you bulk import notes from a given source and into Dendron. The notes are formatted and converted to Dendron's hierarchal structure.\n\n### Export\n\nExporting lets you bulk export notes from Dendron into another destinations. The notes will be formatted and converted to the native format of the destination. \n\n### Publish\n\nPublishing lets you take one note and output it into a different format/destination. \n\nFor example, you might want to use our [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to take a note with [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] and publish it as a regular markdown note to use in a github issue or another tool.\n\nFuture uses of the **publish** method will be taking a note and publishing it to social media (eg. twitter, facebook, linkedin), publishing it to Gmail, and publishing to destinations like Medium and dev.to.\n\n## Types of Pods\n\nThere are two types of pods:\n\n- builtin: created by dendron \n- remote: created by third parties\n\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin#summary,1:]]\n![[dendron.topic.pod.custom#summary,1:]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html","relUrl":"notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html"},{"doc":"Sdk Reference","title":"Sdk Reference","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.sdk","content":"\n\n## PublishPod\n\nBase class to be extended when creating a pod for [[publishing|dendron.topic.pod#publish]]\n\n### plant(opts: PublishPodPlantOpts<T>)\n- opts\n    - engine: DEngineClientV2\n    - config: PublishPodConfig\n    - note: NotePropsV2\n```ts\nexport type NotePropsV2 = {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  desc: string;\n  links: DLink[];\n  fname: string;\n  updated: string;\n  created: string;\n  parent: DNodePointerV2 | null;\n  children: DNodePointerV2[];\n  body: string;\n  custom?: any;\n  schema?: { moduleId: string; schemaId: string };\n  vault: DVault;\n  ...\n};\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html","relUrl":"notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html"},{"doc":"Import","title":"Import","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.import","content":"\nImport pods let you import data from a data source into Dendron\n\n## Configuration\n\n### src\n* description: \"Where to import from\"\n* type: \"string\" as const\n* required: true\n\n### vaultName\n* description: \"name of vault to import into\"\n* type: \"string\" as const\n* required: true\n\n### concatenate\n* description: \"whether to concatenate everything into one note\"\n* type: \"boolean\"\n* default: false\n\nWhen importing, you can either import everything from source as multiple files or concatenate it all together as one file\n\n### frontmatter\n* description: \"frontmatter to add to each note\"\n* type: \"object\"\n\nYou can add custom [[frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] to notes as you import them.

Excecute your pod\n   ```sh\n   dendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource custom --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout\n   ```\n   - since I was running this in a new Dendron vault, I got the following output.\n   - you can change the value of the fname config to an existing note's file name to run it against that note.\n\n```markdown\nHello World\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n\nHere are the basics of Dendron so you can get started growing your knowledge base.\n- [ ] Create your first note.\n    - [ ] Dendron uses the [lookup](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#lookup-menu) command to create. So, hit CMD+L (or ctrl+L if you're on Windows) to bring up the lookup bar, type in a new note name and hit enter to create it. You can also run the lookup command through the command palette \"Dendron: Lookup\".\n    - [ ] Wiki-style links are supported. If the note doesn't exist, we'll create the note for you. For example, just try [[this link]] from the editor view.\n- [ ] Find your notes. Dendron really shines when you need to look up notes quickly. For this, you use *drumroll* the lookup command (again). Just hit CMD/ctrl+L and you can search your entire set of notes.\n- [ ] To delete a note, navigate to it and use the \"Dendron: Delete Node\" command. As with everything else in VSCode, bring up the command palette with CMD/ctrl+shift+P and run the command.\n- [ ] Use a [snippet](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html) for quick note templates\n- [ ] Insert an [image](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html)\n- [ ] Create some [links](https://www.dendron.so/notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html)\n- [ ] [Publish](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html) your vault\n- [ ] Join us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6j85zNX) and discuss all things knowledge management with your fellow trail blazers.\n- [ ] For more information, see Dendron's basic [concepts](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html)\n```\n\n### Pass in custom configuration values\n\nWe're going to make our publishing a little more dynamoc by using custom configuration. \n\nModify your pod to accept a new configuration parameter\n\n```js\nconst { PublishPod } = require(\"@dendronhq/pods-core\");\n\nclass HelloPod extends PublishPod {\n  static id = \"hello\";\n  static description = \"Add a hello statement\";\n\n  get config() {\n    return super.config.concat([\n      {\n        key: \"name\",\n        description: \"dev.to api key\",\n        type: \"string\",\n      },\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  async plant(opts) {\n    const { note, config } = opts;\n    const body = note.body;\n    return [`Hello ${config.name}`, body].join(\"\\n\");\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  pods: [HelloPod],\n};\n\n```\n\nBelow is a diff to make the changes a bit more obvious.\n![diff of code](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-change.jpg)\n\nRun the pod again the the additional argument.\n\n````\n```sh\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource remote --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout,name=Albert\n```\n````\n\n```markdown\nHello Albert\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n...\n```\n\n### Use Note Metadata\n\nPods have full access to all the metadata attached to a note.

A [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) will be added to non-markdown file names to ensure it does not overwrite any existing files.

When using lookup to find a note, each search result is labeled with which vault it belongs to. \n\nWhen creating a note in lookup, the currently opened note's vault is used as the vault for the new note.\n\n#### Specify Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\n![[dendron.topic.config.dendron#lookupconfirmvaultoncreate:#*]]\n\nTo enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.\n\n1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)\n2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:\n\n```yml\nversion: 0\n...\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true\n```\n\n### Navigating Links\n\n- Sample workspace\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1 \n- navigating to `[[dendron://vault2/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1\n\n### Note References\n\n~~[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] are vault specific~~ When you make a reference, Dendron will include the note from the same note. You can create a reference to a note in a different vault by using [[cross vault links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]].\n\n### Publishing\n\nYou can publish from a multi-vault enabled workspace if you are using [[dendron-11ty|pkg.dendron-publishing]] to publish. \n\nWe have added a new configuration, `duplicateNoteBehavior`, which [[controls|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#duplicatenotebehavior-optional]] how Dendron handles duplicate notes across multiple vaults. \n\n### Preset Remote Vaults\n\nWhen you add a [[remote vault|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]], you can either add a vault using a custom git url or select from one of the pre-defined endpoints. Currently, Dendron provide the following remote vaults:\n\n- [AWS Vault](https://aws.dendron.so/)\n- [TLDR Vault](https://tldr.dendron.so/)\n- [Dendron Vault](https://wiki.dendron.so/)\n- [XKCD Vault](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)\n\n### Version Control\n\nFor multi-vault, there are several approaches to version control. If you are using Git, you can either commit everything as one repo or version control your workspace and each vault separately as distinct repos.\n\nIf you use `Vault: Add` with a remote vault, Dendron will automatically add the remote properties to your `dendron.yml` file. See example below.\n\n![[dendron.ref.vaults#remote-workspace-vault,1:*]]\n\nVersioned controlled vaults will be auto-initialized when someone pulls in the workspace. \n\nIf you want to convert a local vault to a remote vault, you can follow the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.cook#convert-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]].\n\n#### File Layout for Multi-Vault Workspace\n\n```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    ├── .git\n    ├── dendron.code-workspace\n    ├── dendron.yml\n    ├── ...\n    ├── vault1\n    │   ├── .git\n    │   ├── root.md\n    │   └── ...\n    └── vault2\n        ├── .git\n        ├── root.md\n        └── ...\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n- Sample Multi-Vault workspace \n\n## Related\n\n- [[Cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html","relUrl":"notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html"},{"doc":"Math","title":"Math","hpath":"dendron.topic.math","content":"Dendron uses [Katex](https://katex.org/) to render math.\n\n- Expressions inside `$...$`  will be rendered using inline format.\n- Expressions inside `$$...$$` will be rendered using block format.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Inline\n\n```\n$f(x) = sin(x)$\n```\n\nwill render as \n\n$f(x) = sin(x)$\n\n### Block\n\n```\n$$\nf(x) = sin(x)\n$$\n```\n\nwill render as\n\n$$\nf(x) = sin(x) \n$$\n\n\n## Cook\n\n### Turn off inline rendering\n\nDue to inline rendering, lines with `$...$` will be rendered using Katex.

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.\n\n## Syntax guide\n\n### Headers\n\n```markdown\n# This is an <h1> tag\n\n## This is an <h2> tag\n\n### This is an <h3> tag\n\n#### This is an <h4> tag\n\n##### This is an <h5> tag\n\n###### This is an <h6> tag\n```\n\n### Emphasis\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\n*This text will be italic*\n_This will also be italic_\n\n**This text will be bold**\n__This will also be bold__\n\n_You **can** combine them_\n\n~~This text will be strikethrough~~\n```\n\n### Lists\n\n#### Unordered List\n\n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2a\n  - Item 2b\n```\n\n#### Ordered List\n\n```markdown\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n1. Item 3\n   1. Item 3a\n   1. Item 3b\n```\n\n#### Definition List\n\n```markdown\nItem 1\n: Definition for Item 1\n\nItem 2\n~ Definition for Item 2\n~ Another definition for Item 2, with a [link](http://www.example.com)\n```\n\n### Images\n\n```markdown\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\n```\n\n### Links\n\n```markdown\nhttps://github.com - automatic!\n[GitHub](https://github.com)\n```\n\n### Blockquote\n\n```markdown\nAs Kanye West said:\n\n> We're living the future so\n> the present is our past.\n```\n\n### Horizontal Rule\n\n```markdown\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n---\n\nAsterisks\n\n---\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\n### Inline code\n\n```markdown\nI think you should use an\n`<addr>` element here instead.\n```\n\n### Fenced code block\n\nYou can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\\`\\`\\`</code> before and after the code block.\n\n#### Syntax Highlighting\n\nYou can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.\n\nFor example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:\n\n````\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n````\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n\n### Task lists\n\n```markdown\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\n- [x] this is a complete item\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\n```\n\n## Extended Syntax\n\nThese are non-standard markdown syntax used in Dendron. Everything here is both available in Dendron's preview as well as when publishing.\n\n### Tables\n\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\nFirst Header | Second Header\n------------ | -------------\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\n```\n\nYou can create a table from existing content using `> Markdown Shortcuts: Add Table` command.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdickin/vscode-markdown-shortcuts/master/media/demo/table_with_header.gif)\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nThe HTML specification\n\n```markdown\n_[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language\n_[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium\nThe HTML specification\nis maintained by the W3C.\n```\n\n### Footnotes\n\n```markdown\nContent [^1]\n\n[^1]: Hi! This is a footnote\n```\n\n### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nYou can use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable. \n\n### Nunjuck Templates\n- status: EXPERIMENTAL\n\nYou can use a limited set of [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to customize your notes. \n\nTo enable, you can set the following to true inside your `dendron.yml`.\n```yml\nuseNunjucks: true\n```\n\nOnce enabled, you'll have access to nunjucks specific constructs. You'll have the same variables available as during [[frontmatter variable substitution|dendron.topic.markdown#frontmatter-variable-substitution]]. Nunjucks templates also get access to the `fname` builtin variable which will be substituted with the filename of the current note. \n\nBelow is an example of what you can do with nunjucks.\n\n- Raw Markdown\n```md\n## Variables\n\n- special variables: {{fname}}\n- special variable as link: [[{{fname}}]]\n- special variable as note ref: ![[{{fname}}#footer]]\n\n## Loops\n\n{% for item in fm.alist %}\n\n- Item: {{item}}\n  {% endfor %}\n\n## Footer\n\nThis is some footer content\n```\n\n- Compiled \n![nunjucks example](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/topic.nunjucks.jpg)\n\n\nNunjucks will work for both the preview and for publishing. It is still an experimental feature which means it might change in backwards in-compatible ways at any point.\n\nIt currently also has the following limitations:\n- disables live preview of markdown (you'll need to refresh the markdown to see changes)\n- will throw an error if you currently have nunjucks like strings inside your notes `eg. {% %}`\n- will throw errors if you refer to an undefined variable `{{ foo }}` \n\n### Diagrams \n\nDendron lets you create Diagrams using [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)\nCreate a code block with mermaid support to use mermaid. The following block turns into the diagram below.\n\n<pre>\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n</pre>\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n\n- NOTE: in order to publish diagrams, you'll need to enable [[mermaid in the config|dendron.topic.config.dendron#mermaid-optional]]\n\n## VSCode Specific Commands\n\n### Markdown Smart Select\n\nThis allows you to expand and shrink selections of markdown using a keyboard shortcut.\n\n- Expand: ⌃⇧⌘→\n- Shrink: ⌃⇧⌘←\n\nSelection applies to the following, and follows a traditional hierarchical pattern:\n\n- Headers\n- Lists\n- Block quotes\n- Fenced code blocks\n- Html code blocks\n- Paragraphs\n\n![preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_51/markdown-smart-select-demo.gif)\n\n> Image by Microsoft\n\n## Compatibility with CommonMark\n\n[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is _a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown_\n\nWhen possible, Dendron will try to stay to `CommonMark` spec for syntax. That being said, many of the features we have (eg. block based note references) have no common mark equivalent which is why we've had to invent new syntax.\n\nYou can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to migrate both individual notes and your entire vault to a CommonMark compatible format.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n- [Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)\n- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n\n## References\n\nThe content of this page is derived from the following sources:\n\n1.

This allows you to link and refer to any part of a note, including paragraphs, lists, and tables.\n\nWe currently (2021.06.04) **do not** support, but are working on:\n* ~~block references in the preview~~\n* auto-complete support for block references\n\n^block-ref-example\n\n\n## Block Anchor\n\nA block anchor is a `^` character, followed by one or more digits, letters, dashes, and underscores. In the future Dendron will automatically generate these, but for now you can add in custom anchors. The following are a few examples of anchors:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor amet ^1234\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2 ^second-item\n* Item 3\n\n^whole-list\n\n| Sapiente | accusamus |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Laborum  | libero    |\n| Ullam    | optio     | ^whole-table\n```\n\n`^whole-list`, `^whole-table`, and `^1234` reference the blocks they are attached to. Lists are special though, `^second-item` only references the list item it is next to.\n\n## Block Links\n\nA block link has the following format. It is created in a note that is referencing a piece of text. When navigating the link, users should be taken to the block anchor. \n\n```\n[[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\nBlock links can link to anchors within the same note without writing the name of the note. For example:\n\n```\nAb voluptatem commodi maiores.\nNemo qui voluptatem dolores. ^my-paragraph\n\nLet's look back at that paragraph: [[#^my-paragraph]]\n```\n\n## Block Reference\n\nBlock References allow you to embed a block marked by an anchor in another note. \n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n```\nAb voluptatem commodi maiores.\nNemo qui voluptatem dolores. ^my-paragraph\n\n* Culpa autem et voluptatem reiciendis id sint.\n* Qui quos ut a deserunt. ^second-item\n* Minima quos consequatur quo eum quas aut.\n\n^all-items\n\nI want to refer to that paragraph again:\n\n![[#^my-paragraph]]\n\nAnd let's look at that list again:\n\n![[#^all-items]]\n\nI want to re-emphasize that second item:\n\n![[#^second-item]]\n\nYou can reference across notes as well. Say you had a note named \"other-note\" which had an anchor \"some-anchor\" in it:\n\n![[other-note#^some-anchor]]\n```\n\n\nWhen you refer to a block anchor, it will display the block that the block anchor is attached to. This means you can refer to an entire paragraph, table, list, or even a list item.\n\nBelow is an example to a block reference to an earlier part of this page.\n\n![[#^block-ref-example]]\n\n## Block Reference Range\n\nYou can also refer to block anchors in ranges. This allows you to refer to multiple paragraph, multiple list items etc. using a single reference.

This is the `root.md`. \n\n### Domain\n\nThe domain is the root of a specific hierarchy. In our example vault, we have one domain - `dendron`.\n\n## Why Hierarchies?\n\nDendron is built around hierarchies and the axiom that a canonical hierarichal representation of notes is one of the most effective ways of managing large numbers of notes. You can read more about the thoughts behind this [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/127a3230-4484-433a-b97f-178679564207.html).\n\n## What's with the `.`'s?\n\n1. It allows each **file** to also be a **folder**. This means your notes can have data but also contain other notes. \n2. It makes it much easier to perform certain refactoring operations. For example, say you had the following [[schema|dendron.topic.schema]]\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-a\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n   Lets say you wanted to make `child-b` a child of `child-a`\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n   - id: child-a\n   children:\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n    With the classical folder hierarchy, you would need to turn `child-a` into a folder and then create a custom file to hold the content from the original `child-a`\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           ├── child-a-note\n           └── child-b\n   ```\n    With the `.` delimited hierarchy, this becomes a simple rename operation\n   ```\n   .\n   ├── a-parent.child-a\n   └── a-parent.child-a.child-b\n   ```\n3. It allows us to create [[stubs|dendron.topic.schema]] for parts of the hierarchy that don't exist and not clutter our file system with empty folders. With the classical folder hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           └── grandchild-a\n               └── great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n   With the `.` delimited hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent.child-a.grandchild-a.great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html","relUrl":"notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html"},{"doc":"Graph View","title":"Graph View","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view","content":"\n## Summary\n\n-   Visualize the notes and schemas in your workspace in a graph view\n-   Click on a node to open up the corresponding note/schema in your workspace\n-   Much faster startup times than the legacy note/schema graph\n    -   Scales to virtually any size graph\n\n## Commands\n\n### Show Note Graph V2\n\nLaunch the command palette (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-palette]]): `> Dendron: Show Note Graph V2`\n\nClick on a node to open up the corresponding note in your workspace.\n\nThe note graph currently only supports hierarchical note connections. Future versions of the graph will support linked note connections and the ability to add custom filters and styling to your graph.\n\n### Show Schema Graph V2\n\nLaunch the command palette (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-palette]]): `> Dendron: Show Schema Graph V2`\n\nClick on a node to open up the corresponding schema in your workspace.\n\nThe schema graph shows high level connections between a vault's `root` schema and other schemas within the vault. These other schemas may have other nodes connected to them representing additional children of that schema.\n\n## Filter View\n\nIn the top left of both the note and schema graphs lives the graph filter view.

These fields support multiple arguments in the form of a comma-separated or space-separated list.\n\n-   **Allowlist**: Graph nodes including any of these string arguments will be **included** in the graph\n-   **Blocklist**: Graph nodes including any of these string arguments will be **excluded** from the graph\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n-   Allow: `journal.2021, dog`\n    -   Include any notes that include either `journal.2021` or `dog` in their name or filename\n-   Block: `cat`\n    -   Exclude any notes with `cat` in their name or filename\n\n#### Other Filters\n\n-   **Show Stubs**: When checked, show stub notes in the graph\n\n### Options\n\n-   **Allow Relayout**: When checked, layout the graph again when the graph configuration is updated.\n    -   This is useful in instances you'd like to preserve the current layout but add/remove information, e.g. adding link connections to a hierarchical graph while maintaining readability\n\n### Information\n\nPrimarily for debugging, this section has information about graph size. Edge counts are calculated individually from the actual rendered edges, so may not represent the true rendered count if a certain type of edge is hidden.\n\n-   **Linked Edges**: Number of linked connections between nodes\n-   **Hierarchical Edges**: Number of hierarchical connections between nodes\n-   **Nodes**: Number of nodes in the graph\n\n## RFCs\n\n-   [[7 Graph Rework|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework]]\n\n---\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html","relUrl":"notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html"},{"doc":"Prune","title":"Prune","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view.prune","content":"\n## Legacy Note Graph\n- [[Pruning ✂️|dendron.ref.status#pruning-️]]\n\nDendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension.\n\nThe Dendron graph view is generated using our hierarchical index.

The title of the note will be applied as the note alias. If you highlight a header, dendron will create a relative link to the header with the alias set to the header value.\n\nYou can also highlight any line of text, and Dendron will create a link to it by inserting a block anchor, or copy an existing anchor.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/06d0689d548941219db9708f5b1b70d2\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/06d0689d548941219db9708f5b1b70d2-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you use this command in a [[multi vault|dendron.topic.multi-vault]] workspace, Dendron will create a [[cross vault link|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] to the note in question.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/command.copy-link.gif)\n\n### Copy Note Ref\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+r`\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+r`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nCopies a reference to the current open document\n\nThis lets you quickly create a [[note reference|dendron.topic.refs]] to the current note.\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-note.gif)\n\n#### Header Selection\nIf you have a header selected while running this command, it will copy the note ref with the selected header to the next note ref.\n\n#### Block Selection\nIf you have some text selected, Dendron can insert block anchors to reference the region you have selected.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57.78491171749599%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b72a562626a0483f967e724ef8f2d457\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n#### Range Selection\nIf you highlight multiple blocks, Dendron can create a range selection that spans the blocks selected.

You can configure a starting hierarchy for this command. Useful if you designated a hierarchy (eg. `templates`) for insertions.\n\n- configuration: [[defaultInsertHierarchy|dendron.topic.config.dendron#defaultinserthierarchy]]\n\n### Insert Note Link\n\nInsert the note link into the current document using lookup.\n\n### Move Note\n\nMove a note. Also includes option to move a note between vaults\n\n### Paste Link\n\nTransform URL in clipboard to nicely formatted markdown link\n\n### Random Note\n\nNavigates to a random note in the workspace. By default, all notes are included in the set that can be navigated to with this command. This can be adjusted with the `randomNote` setting in the Dendron Config (see [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]]).\n\n```yaml\n# Sample configuration in dendron.yml:\nrandomNote:\n    include:\n        - alpha\n        - beta.foo\n    exclude:\n        - alpha.bar\n```\n\nThis pattern would specify a set including all notes under `alpha` _except_ for notes in the alpha.bar hierarchy. The set would also include notes under `beta.foo*`.\n\n- If `include` is not specified, then the `include` matching pattern will match all notes.\n- `exclude` takes precedence over `include`, so if the patterns are identical, no notes will match.\n\n### Rename Note\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nRename a note and all backlinks.\n\nIf the title is the same as what Dendron would autogenerate (kebab-case capitalized), then refactor will change the title as well. Otherwise, it will preserve the existing title.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/command-rename.gif)\n\n### Show Preview\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - windows: `windows+ctrl+p`\n  - mac: `cmd+ctrl+p`\n\nShow Markdown Preview\n\n---\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Lookup\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+L`\n  - key: `ctrl+l`\n\nInitiate note lookup\n\n![[dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\n### Lookup (Journal Note)\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+j`\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+j`\n  - args: `{'noteType': 'journal'}`\n\nInitiate note lookup with journal note pre-selected\n\n### Lookup (Scratch Note)\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+s`\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+s`\n  - args: `{'noteType': 'scratch', 'selectionType': 'selection2link'}`\n\nInitiate note lookup with scratch note pre-selected\n\n### Lookup Schema\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+L`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+l`\n\nInitiate schema lookup\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\n### Open Link\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nOpen link to external file (eg. pdf, .mov, etc) use system default.

Necessary for Dendron to pick up on schema changes.\n\n### Archive Hierarchy\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nMove current note and all children under the `archive` hierarchy\n\nThis is a convenience method around `Refactor Hierarchy` for the case of archiving hierarchies you are no longer using. For example, if you were currently at `pro.foo`, running `Archive Hierarchy` would be equivalent to running `Refactor Hierarchy` with the following arguments:\n\n- matcher: `pro.foo`\n- replacement: `archive.pro.foo`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/9698d5a4451b49d8b107f3ff67d97877\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/9698d5a4451b49d8b107f3ff67d97877-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Refactor Hierarchy\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nUpdate hierarchy using regex\n\nLike `Rename Note` but works on an entire hierarchy of notes. This command takes two arguments:\n\n- matcher: regex that matches text you want to capture for replacement\n- replacer: regex that represents text you want to use as replacement\n\nAfter running the command, you will be taken to a preview that shows all files that will be affected. You will be given an option in a dropdown to either proceed with the refactor or cancel the operation.\n\n- NOTE: Dendron will warn you if refactoring will overwrite existing files. You will need to either change your `replacer` or move the affected files before Dendron will perform a refactor\n\nRefactor Hierarchy is a huge time-saver:\n<https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/743194856788328497/743195382795993291>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Goto Note\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+enter`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGoto to the note under the cursor, creating it if it doesn't exist.\n\n### Go Up\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+up`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+up`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to closet non-stub parent of the currently open note\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-up.gif)\n\n### Go Next Sibling\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+]`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to the next sibling\n\nSiblings with numeric names will be sorted numerically, whereas siblings with alphabetical names will be sorted alphabetically when determining the next sibling.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Previous Sibling\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+[`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to the previous sibling\n\nSiblings with numeric names will be sorted numerically, whereas siblings with alphabetical names will be sorted alphabetically when determining the previous sibling.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Down\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+down`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+down`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo down the hierarchy\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-down.gif)\n\n---\n\n## Hooks\n\n### Hook Create\n\nCreate a custom [[hook|dendron.topic.hooks]] to trigger during Dendron's lifecycle.

You can skip this initial indexing if you have a current Dendron workspace running. \n\nIn that case, the CLI can connect to the current engine instead of starting a new one using the following command. \n\n```bash\ncd {root/of/workspace}\n# .dendron.port has the port of the current running workspace\nnpx dendron buildSite --wsRoot . --stage dev --serve --enginePort `cat .dendron.port`\n```\n\n### Using a custom port\n\n\n## Pod Commands\n\n- NOTE: you can find pod ids in the [[pods|dendron.topic.pod]] page. Just add a `.import|.export` to the end of the id (eg. `dendron.pod.json.import`)\n\n### Export Pod\n\n- export a pod\n\n- eg: Export notes to JSONPod\n\n```\ndendron exportPod --podId dendron.json --wsRoot . \n```\n\n### Import Pod\n\n- eg: Import notes from FilePod\n\n```\ndendron importPod --podId dendron.markdown --wsRoot . \n```\n\n### Publish Pod\n\n- eg: Publish a note as regular markdown\n\n```bash\ndendron publishPod --wsRoot . --podId dendron.markdown --noteByName dendron\n```\n\n## Vault Commands\n\n```sh\ndendron vault <cmd>\n\nvault related commands\n\nPositionals:\n  cmd  a command to run                  [string] [required] [choices: \"create\"]\n\nOptions:\n  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]\n  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]\n  --wsRoot          location of workspace\n  --vault           name of vault\n  --quiet           don't print output to stdout\n  --enginePort      If set, connect to to running engine.

The biggest factors for choosing Dendron are the hierarchical structure, the multiple vaults, and the many existing VS Code extensions.\n\n> Hierarchies make a lot more sense to my brain. And some of the research I've glanced at suggests it is better for PKM than tags or other free-form structures.\n\n> Having multiple vaults made me comfortable jumping fully into Dendron. I currently have 3 separate vaults: one for my daily life & work as a librarian/journal editor, a second for my dissertation-related things, and a third that my wife & I will soon start syncing on our separate computers. I'll eventually make a fourth for notes I'll publish on my website—but this is the start of the semester, and I have to avoid that kind of exciting but time-intensive project at the moment! I appreciate that references will work between these vaults—but I don't need to worry about accidentally sharing a note with a link to \"project.kitchen-plumbing-disaster\" with my dissertation advisor, or flood my wife's computer with my reading notes and dissertation idea fragments. This fundamental separation lets me feel comfortable using one tool for all these disparate domains.\n\n> Having the full range of existing VS Code extensions for things like Pandoc, BibTeX, or Zotero, plus web development, means that I don't need to hope that someone else involved with Obsidian, Foam, etc will make a plug-in that does what I need for an edge case use. Dendron plugs into a much larger pool of people, many of whose are doing academic and web-related work. I don't do much with data analysis, but I imagine it would be nice to use VS Code tools for Python or R in the same program one uses for academic writing.\n\n- Ryan, Librarian","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html","relUrl":"notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html"},{"doc":"Myles","title":"Myles","hpath":"dendron.testimonials.myles","content":"\n> I started taking organised notes in 1993.

I was frequently changing my tools without a fixed workflow in the early days of stepping into the productivity and note taking world, it is just great to see that so many cool guys are building tools to make knowledge management a pleasure and more efficient. I met Dendron at the time that I was in a chaos state using different note taking apps like Roam, Obsidian, Evernote, etc and had been sticking with it for a couple months now. I have also tried other tools meanwhile as well but eventually I always turn my head back to Dendron.\n> \n> Dendron is: \n> - [x] open source\n> - [x] build your own workflow\n> - [x] write, store and publish\n> - [x] good community and support \n> - [x] cool guys in the core team\n>  \n> which suits my taste (**a lot**). So to speak, working my notes inside dendron is a pleasure as well. Dislike other note taking apps, in Dendron both hierarchy and linking is provided and you can combine them according to your likings. Referencing to [this article](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app) from Nesslabs, Dendron fits both **Gardeners** and **Librarians** by combining the power of _hierarchy, linking and publishing_. Garderners can just ignore the hierarchy and do the linking while Librarians can focus on the hierarchy through the naming of the notes with each hierarchy separated by periods `.` . The `C-l` lookup feature is absolutely great too. If you are in between both categories (like me), then Dendron is definitely your first choice for hybrid workflows. \n> \n> Publishing notes is a pleasure as well (finally) by [managed publishing](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ae4a0c98-e2ea-47e0-8a20-016eba3424be.html) and you can directly publish your notes after hosting them on github (of course you can make it private too I think) instead of rewriting them and publish them as a website. **Everyone can build their second brain or wiki.**\n> \n> I store everything in Dendron now and I know it's secure and they're simply plain text markdown files so no one knows (and cares) if I store anything personal or not. Although Dendron is not perfect (yet) and have some room of improvement, it suits my needs personally and these issues will eventually be solved by cool guys in the team or in the open source community. \n> \n> If you think Dendron is interesting, just give it a try and start building your second brain.\n>  \n> That's all I want to say and I apologize for the profanity in the title if you feel offended.

Editing in OneNote always felt loose and sloppy--I could never get my notes to look consistent and I could never tell which styles apply where (copy-pasting brings source styles into OneNote and sometimes they mess with line spacing which is very annoying to fix). Hating your note-taking tool does not lead to better productivity, but I kept telling myself there was a PEBCAK and made fewer and fewer notes.\n> \n> Someone suggested I should use Joplin as a more secure alternative to OneNote, and there I went down the rabbit hole of note-taking apps. Keeping notes in Markdown wasn't a new concept to me, but didn't pay much attention to it before trying out Joplin. It was a step up from OneNote, but it turned out there are so many good note-taking apps that I needed to take notes:\n> \n> * Boost Note\n> * Crossnote\n> * DokuWiki\n> * Dynalist\n> * em (not released)\n> * EverNote\n> * FSNotes\n> * GitNote\n> * Inkdrop\n> * Joplin\n> * Markdown Notes for VS Code (VSCode)\n> * nb\n> * Neutron\n> * Notable\n> * Notational Velocity\n> * NoteBag\n> * Notion\n> * nvUlta\n> * Obsidian\n> * Quoll Writer\n> * Roam Research\n> * Simplenote\n> * Standard Notes\n> * ThiefMD\n> * TiddlyWiki\n> * Trillium\n> * Turtl\n> * Typora\n> * VS Note (VSCode)\n> * VSCode Foam Bubble Extension (VSCode)\n> * VsCode Memo (VSCode)\n> * Workflowy\n> * Zettlr\n> * Zim - A Desktop Wiki\n> \n> There.

The [Dendron Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1).\n\nThe public roadmap is designed to give you more information about what features and functionality you can expect from Dendron over the coming months. With more transparency into what we’re building, you can share feedback earlier and have more influence into what we’re building.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-05-29-00-38-50.png)\n\n## Context\n\nOur roadmap is intended to align with Dendron's overall [[Mission statement|dendron.mission-statement]]. We have only added the top-level \"epics\" to our roadmap i.e. the large things that will have a lot of impact on the user experience.\n\nThis year, we plan to focus on three things to maximize impact:\n\n1. **Build out Dendron's core functionality**: lookup, schemas, pods, visualization, preview, sharing, plugins, and performance. These are some of the foundational features Dendrologists rely on everyday and we will make sure that they keep getting better. We will continue to add new features, improve existing features, and make sure that the core note-taking functionality is more intuitive and easier to use over time.\n\n2. **Create a Federated Knowledge Repository**. The promise of Dendron is to help people manage knowledge at scale. Most knowledge already exists in READMEs, specs, and other places. We want to make it easy to access both existing content as well as for Dendrologists to share their own.\n\n3. **Build out Dendron for Teams**. Dendron is great to use as an individual but is even more powerful when used with others. To this end, we are building out authentication, synchronization and sharing features to make Dendron a best in class tool for collaboration.\n\nThese goals lead us to the following set of features. These can definitely change (and they're really the highlights amongst all the other enhancements and bug fixes) but hopefully this gives you a birds-eye view of what we're delivering.\n\n### In Q3\n\n-   [Unified Markdown Preview](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/643)\n-   [Standalone Vaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/41)\n-   [Schema Improvements](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/712)\n-   [Private published sites](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/758)\n-   [Markdown export pod](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/541)\n\n### In Q4\n\n-   [Advanced Queries](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159)\n-   [Database storage layer](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/759)\n-   [Better autocomplete](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/663)\n-   [Synchronization Pods](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/732)\n-   [Better Pods](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/701)\n\nWe'll be sure to add more issues here, but go over to the [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1) if you want the latest info.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have questions or comments, share them either as [Github issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new/choose) or in the `#feedback` channel [in Discord](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ).\n\nIn addition to the content of the roadmap being updated regularly, we will also iterate on the format of the roadmap itself. We see the potential of reactions, issue comments, and even GitHub Discussions being useful for receiving direct signals back from the community about what we’ve planned. If you have feedback about the roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know on Discord as well.\n\n## How can you help?\n\nWe're really lucky to have a strong community committed to building open-source knowledge management tools. There are a few ways to get involved:\n\n1. **Bug Bash:** We're always working on performance and stability improvements, please [file actionable bugs](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) with good details. It'll help us prioritize them and fix them!\n2. **Document and Publish:** We're on a journey to improve documentation in all forms. If you're interested in contributing, please help build out a strong list of preset vaults - [PKM](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [TLDR](https://tldr.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) or [this wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/).\n3. **Develop:** A super impactful way to get involved is by working on and delivering one of the community-picked features.

Also, what happens if there's a filename collision across vaults?\n\n## Jojo\n\nmulti-vault support is on the roadmap for this year. for naming collisions, i was thinking the following:\n\n- by default, surface all results with the vault name in the prefix\n\nsay a user has the following vaults\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── kevin-vault\n    │   └── python.hello.md\n    └── jojo-vault\n        └── python.hello.md\n```\n\nuser enters the following lookup: `python.hello`\n\nthey should see the following result\n\n```\npython.hello - kevin vault\npython.hello - jojo vault\n```\n\nwe can also introduce a vault specific prefix (eg. {vault}/{path}) to un-ambiguously specify our result\n\nuser would type `kevin-vault/python.hello` to specify they want to access `kevin-vault`\n\n\"why don't we just show all matches for an unprefixed link\" - this would work inside vscode, but if the user just publishes the workspace with conflicting vaults, I guess the link must point to some single pre-selected place(?). Also, I think the intent behind the link is to point to a single location, so asking user to fix it would probably be reasonable.\nThere's probably all kind of complex scenarios that we could envision (e.g. what if the user would like to merge domains across vaults and show all merged notes in the published page as a merged web page?), but then again 99.9% of the real cases probably just want to use multiple folders and avoid conflicts. Showing errors would probably be the easiest and still sufficient solution.\n\n### Kevin\n\ncoming back to this thread. agree with your conclusion. the other solution would be to generate a popup/intermediary page for links with multiple destinations and let the user choose.\ne\nfor v1, would bias for what you suggested and error at build time. \n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html","relUrl":"notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html"},{"doc":"Entries","title":"Entries","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html","relUrl":"notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html"},{"doc":"Backlog","title":"Backlog","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html","relUrl":"notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html"},{"doc":"Org Mode","title":"Org Mode","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.org-mode","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport org-mode sytnax within Dendron\n\n## Details\n\nThis project discusses how to best incorporate org-mode functionality into dendron\n\n## Proposals\n\n1. support {file}.org files\n2. support `org` syntax within `md` files\n\n### 1.

This can be implemented using the React Sortable Tree plugin, which will also be used for creating schemas.\n\n#### Organising the information connected to a node in a semantic and legible manner\n\nA standard graph view spreads the connected nodes arbitratily around the outside of a parent node. This is useful for understanding the general 'shape' of the connections between notes, but in order to understand the immediate connections between any particular note it is easier if they are arranged in a structured and comprehensible fashion. A view that visualises notes in a mindmap style format can achieve this.\n\n#### Activating mindmap view\n\nThe mindmap view can be triggered through the command palette as a Dendron command, as well as from an icon in the Activity Bar, or through the right-click context menu on a note. Launching it from the activity bar or command palette will launch it in the root of your vault, while launching it from the right click context menu on a note will open it focused to that particular note.\n\n#### Indication of related note\n\nWhen a note is opened from the mindmap view (or the mindmap view is opened from a note), it is linked so that navigating to other notes via the mindmap panel will open them in that same panel. This can be indicated by an icon in the menu bar of the linked panel, or an icon in the tab in the linked panel.\n\n#### Creation of new child notes by clicking\n\nA '+' icon on a note when clicked can add a child note underneath that note.\n\n#### Schema visualisation\n\nA mindmap-style visualisation lends itself to visualising the abstract concept of a schema. A note with a schema applied shows the potential nodes that it could have according to the schema as transparent notes with a '+' symbol, which when clicked will create that note.\n\n#### Expanding scope of mindmap focus\n\nThe mindmap view can also be expanded to show additional generations of notes from the same focused note (the grandparents and grandchildren of the focused note). There are '+' and '-' buttons in the mindmap view panel to increase or decrease the amount of visible generations.\n\n#### Configuration options\n\nTBD\n\n## Questions\n\n### What is the difference between this and Dendron's graph view?\n\nThe graph view shows an overview of your _entire knowledge base_ and can be traversed by scrolling and zooming. This can be useful for understand the general structure of all your notes, and the broad relationships between domains in your hierarchy but is less suited for focusing on a particular domain.\n\nThe mindmap view would allow users to focus their attention on a particular node, it's siblings, parents and children, view them in a visually organised manner, and traverse their notes by selecting notes directly attached to that domain. In this sense, it is more suited to giving you an overview of a particular _domain_.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [The Brain App](https://www.thebrain.com/)\n- [Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/766252142549270550)\n- [React Sortable Tree](https://github.com/mikcaweb/react-sortable-tree)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html","relUrl":"notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html"},{"doc":"Related","title":"Related","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs","content":"- [github issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/261)\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport custom colorization of tabs in Dendron, specified by schema. \n\n## Details\n\nVSCode has the following settings for tabs. \n\n```\n\"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n    \"tab.activeBackground\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.activeForeground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.inactiveForeground\":\"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.inactiveBackground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.border\":\"#FFFFFF\"\n}\n```\n\nThe properties that can be customized are `activeBackground` and `inactiveBackground`.

Currently, all of Dendron's indexing capabilities is provided by the `dendron engine` as a library which is included in every extension that uses it. This has many drawbacks - every extension re-indexes all notes and also blocks the client (vscode) during this process.\n\nThe Dendron server migration is to move Dendron to a client server architecture. Note that the migration will involve standing up **two servers**: one for language server functionality (the lsp server), and another for dendron's [lookup](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) capabilities (the express server). \n\nThe rationale for having two servers is discussed [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/748936364283920495/759153642644701285).\n\nThey are also elaborated upon [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/765435624878505985)\n\nInstead of calling the engine directly, the Dendron extension, as well as related plugins, will communicate to Dendron's server using IPC and on local ports. \n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] add LSP server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] add api server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] hook server into dendron startup (0.12.4)\n- [x] migrate lookup to server model \n  - [x] support query notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support query notes with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write note with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support delete note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support query schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support write schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support delete schema  (0.12.7)\n- [x] optimize server lookup performance (0.12.7)\n- [x] enable file watcher (0.12.7)\n- [x] dendron tree view (0.12.7)\n- [x] migrate commands\n  - [x] scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note command (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note url (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] global journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] build pod (0.12.8)\n  - [x] rename note\n  - [x] archive hierarchy\n  - [x] refactor hiearchy\n  - [x] doctor\n- [x] integration tests for all server functionality\n\n## Next\n\n- migrate bundled extensions to server model\n- use custom goto definition provider \n- use custom backlink definition provider\n- use schema based completions\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable server mode, update the following setting in your workspace settings `\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true`.

While both characteristics matter, we agree to make these tradeoffs when necessary.\n\n-   function over form\n    -   in dendron, its more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful\n    -   the focus in dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them\n-   focus on speed\n    -   we can't predict the future but its likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower\n    -   when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed\n-   focus on hierarchies\n    -   while dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies\n-   retrieval over insertion\n    -   Knowledge only compounds if it's easy to refer back to and connect messages weeks, months or even years after it's written. We value structure that provides enough context for your notes to be valuable for the long haul.\n\n## Related\n\n-   [[dendron.principles]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html","relUrl":"notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html"},{"doc":"Power functionality v0","title":"Power functionality v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.power-functionality","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport power user functionality \n\n## Details\n\nTBD\n\n## Tasks\n\n- schemas\n  - [ ] [specify sections within notes](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/248)\n\n## Next\n\nTBD\n\n## Links\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.power-func-v0)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html","relUrl":"notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html"},{"doc":"Pods v0","title":"Pods v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.pods","content":"## Goal\n\nMake it possible for people to import/export their data between Dendron and **any other** platform that contains information a user might care about.\t\n\n## Details\n\nDendron wants to be your **central digital nervous system** - our end goal is to be the **best possible way** to create, build, use, and share the knowledge that matters to you. \t\nTo do that effectively, we believe its important that you have **full control of your information**. This means having your data available in plaintext markdown and having an note-taking tool that is local and open source. But we want to go further than that which is where [pods](TODO) come in. \t\nDendron refers to a pod as anything you could conceivably use to store/publish notes.

Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Concepts\n\n![[dendron.ref.workspace#summary,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.ref.vaults#summary,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#hierarchies:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#domain:#*]]\n\n## Specs\n\n- a workspace can have one or more vaults\n- a workspace can have one or more workspace configs\n- vaults have a path relative to the workspace and an optional name\n  <!-- - the initial vault is called `main` -->\n  <!-- - vaults can be referred to by name using the `$` prefix  -->\n\n## Flow\n\n### Initialization\n\nTo facilitate separation and re-usability of vaults, we are changing how the initial workspace is laid out in Dendron.\n\nToday, all files (configuration, vaults, docs) are located directly inside the **workspace root**.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-legacy-workspace,1:#*]]\n\nWith multivault, workspace configuration  will be moved underneath a separate folder underneath the **configuration root**. By default, this will inside a folder named **config**.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\nInside a multi-vault workspace, each vault and config will be initialized as separate and independent git repositories. To initialize a multi-vault workspace, you can run `Dendorn: Initialize MultiVault Workspace` to bootstrap the folder layout that you see above. \n\nWe will also be releasing a migration script that can convert a single vault workspace into a multi-vault workspace. \n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `dendron.yml` file will be modified to have additional metadata for vaults that have remote repositories associated with them. A remote root is not required unless you plan on cloning your workspace to other computers. \n\n```yml\nvaults:\n  - fsPath: vault1\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault1/repo\n  - fsPath: vault2\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault2/repo\n      branch: nightly # optional, target specific branch\n```\n\n### Cloning\n\nCloning is the act of checking out a workspace on another machine. To clone, Dendron will have the `Dendron: Clone Workspace` command. It will take the url of a remote **workspace configuration** repo as input as well as a local path for the **workspace root**. Cloning will checkout the _workspace configuration_ underneath the _workspace root_ and also checkout all the vaults that are associated with the configuration underneath the workspace.\n\n### Add a new Vault\n\n- run `Dendron: Add Vault`\n  - specify file path relative to the current **workspace root**\n  - specify an optional user friendly name for the vault\n    - if no name is set, the last component of the file path will be used\n- when the user hits enter, the vault is created as an \"empty vault\"\n  - empty vaults will contain a `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` file\n\n### Lookup\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- lookup: {empty query}\n  - show all top level results of all vaults. note how the vault name shows up in parenthesis next to the result\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    root (vault2)\n    foo (vault1)\n    foo (vault2)\n    ```\n- lookup: `vault1/`\n  - by prefixing lookup with the vault name, you can narrow results to a particular vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    foo (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.`\n  - dendron will merge all results from all vaults when you do a lookup\n  - results\n    ```\n    foo.one (vault2)\n    foo.two (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.new`\n  - when you lookup a note that doesn't exist, you'll have the option of creating the note in either vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    Create New (vault2)\n    Create New (vault1)\n    ```\n\n### Navigating Links\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n  - the UI should be similar to the **Peek Action**\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-10-19-20-48-52.png)\n\n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open foo in vault1 \n\n### Moving Notes Between Vaults\n\n- TBD\n\n### Publishing Notes\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- configuration to publish everything under foo\n  -

It is also a process for reviewing and discussing the\nproposal and tracking its implementation. \"Request for Comments\" means a request\nfor discussion and oversight about the future of Dendro from contributors and\nusers. It is an open forum for suggestions, questions, and feedback.\n\nThe process is intended to be as lightweight and reasonable as possible for the\npresent circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by\nconsensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.\n\nThe RFC process itself is subject to changes as dictated by the core team and\nthe community. Proposals can include proposed changes to the RFC process itself\nto better serve contributors.\n\n## When to submit an RFC?\n\nYou should consider using this process if you intend to make \"substantial\"\nchanges to [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) or related tools.\nSome examples that would benefit from an RFC are:\n\n-   Major new features where the desired exprience is ambiguous.\n-   Any change to existing APIs that could break existing code.\n-   The removal of existing features or public APIs.\n-   Changes to the documented contribution workflow.\n-   Features that cross multiple construct libraries.\n-   Additions or changes to framework capabilities.\n\nThe RFC process is a great opportunity to get more eyeballs on your proposal\nbefore it becomes a part of a released version of Dendron. Quite often, even\nproposals that seem \"obvious\" can be significantly improved once a wider group\nof interested people have a chance to weigh in.\n\nThe RFC process can also be helpful to encourage discussions about a proposed\nfeature as it is being designed, and incorporate important constraints into the\ndesign while it's easier to change, before the design has been fully\nimplemented.\n\nIf you submit a pull request to implement a new major feature without going\nthrough the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC\nfirst.\n\nSome changes do not require an RFC:\n\n-   Bugfixes for known issues.\n-   Additions only likely to be _noticed by_ other developers of Dendro, invisible\n    to end product users.\n\nIf you're not sure whether your change requires an RFC, feel free to create an\nissue and ask.\n\n## RFC Process\n\nIn short, to get a major feature added to Dendron, one usually writes an RFC as\na markdown file and gets it approved and mergd into the Dendron-site. At that\npoint the RFC is 'in review' and may be implemented.\n\n1. [Create a **tracking issue**](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=work-item.md&title=)\n   for the proposed feature if one doesn't already exist. If a tracking issue\n   already exists, make sure to update it and assign it to let others know\n   you're working on a proposal. tracking issue number and `<my-feature>` is the\n   rfc title.\n2. Fill in an RFC under the rfc.\\* hierarchy on dendron-site. Put care into the\n   details: **We welcome all honest efforts to contribute.**.\n3. Submit a **pull request** with the title `RFC: ### <title>` where ### is the\n   tracking issue number and title is the name of the proposal. As a pull\n   request the RFC will receive design feedback from the core team and the\n   larger community, and the author should be prepared to make revisions in\n   response.\n4. Update the tracking issue with a link to the RFC PR.\n5. **Advertise** your RFC amongst stakeholders via social channels (e.g.\n   Discord) and your team. Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that\n   have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that\n   don't receive any comments.\n6. Eventually, the team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion\n   in a future release of Dendron..\n7. RFCs that are candidates for inclusion will enter a \"**final comment\n   period**\" lasting 3 calendar days. The beginning of this period will be\n   signaled by a team member adding a comment and label on the RFCs pull\n   request.\n8. An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the team and community.\n   Significant modifications may trigger a new final comment period. An RFC can\n   also be modified after it has been merged and approved, in which case a new\n   PR will be submitted with the modification, like any other code.\n9. An RFC may be **rejected** by the team after public discussion has settled\n   and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member\n   of the team will then close the PR and issue.\n10. An RFC may be **accepted** at the close of its final comment period. A team\n    member will merge the RFCs associated pull request, at which point the RFC\n    will become 'approved'.\n11. At some point, someone will pick up the RFC for implementation. For major\n    features this usually requires devising a detailed implementation plan. To\n    that end, submit an **additional PR** on the RFC doc that either fills in\n    the \"Implementation Plan\" section or references a separate document or\n    GitHub Project Board which includes the plan.\n12. Once this PR is approved, the RFC will move to the 'implementing' state.\n    Usually we track implementation using GitHub projects.\n13. Once implementation is complete, the RFC moves to 'done', and it's issue is\n    closed.\n\n> If the submitter is someone from our community (i.e., not core team member), a\n> core team member will be assigned to 'shepherd' each proposal. They will\n> generally be the ones updating the RFCs state in the tracking issue as it\n> moves through the process. They can decide when a final comment period is\n> triggered.\n\n## RFC States\n\n1. **💡 proposed** - A tracking issue has been created with a basic outline of\n   the proposal.\n2. **✍️ review** - An RFC document has been written with a detailed design and a\n   PR is under review. At this point the PR will be assigned a **shepherd** from\n   the core team.\n3. **⏰ final comments** - The shepherd has approved the RFC PR, and announces\n   that the RFC enters a period for final comments before it will be approved\n   (~1wk). At this stage, if major issues are raised, the RFC may return to\n   **Review**.\n4. **👍 approved** - The RFC PR is approved and merged to `master`, and the RFC\n   is now ready to be implemented.\n5. **🗺️ planning** - A PR is created with the **Implementation Plan** section of\n   the RFC.\n6. **👷 implementing** - Implemetation plan is approved and merged and the RFC\n   is actively being implemented.\n7. **1️⃣ phase one done** - Implementation for phase 1/2/3 is complete. These phases will be determined in the RFC and a single RFC can have at maximum 3 phases.\n8. **✅ done** - Implementation is complete and merged across appropriate\n   repositories.\n9. **👎 rejected** - During the review period, the RFC may be rejected and then\n   it will be marked as such.\n\n---\n\nDendron's RFC process\n[looks up](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\nto [AWS CDK RFC process], [Yarn RFC process], [Rust RFC process], [React RFC\nprocess], and [Ember RFC process]\n\n[aws cdk rfc process]: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs\n[yarn rfc process]: https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs\n[rust rfc process]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs\n[react rfc process]: https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs\n[ember rfc process]: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f143ca38-dcc6-4cd3-b84b-997aec1160ef.html","relUrl":"notes/f143ca38-dcc6-4cd3-b84b-997aec1160ef.html"},{"doc":"9 Note Lifecycle Hooks","title":"9 Note Lifecycle Hooks","hpath":"dendron.rfc.9-note-lifecycle-hooks","content":"\n## Goals\n\nCreate plugin system that can execute custom logic when notes are being changed.\n\n## Context\n\nWe currently have limited ways of programmatically updating a note while editing in Dendron.

At runtime, when Dendron creates/updates/changes a note, it will call the corresponding plugins in the order they were registered via the yml.\n\nDendron currently supports a node minimum runtime of v12 which means javascript plugins that target this environment should be supported. \n\nWe also have an escape hatch for non-javascript executables using [execa](#execacommandcommand-options) to execute an existing binary. Note that you'll have to pass in the note object yourself to the given binary. \n\nYou can see the example of a note object [[here|pkg.dendron-engine.ref.note-response]]\n\n## Example\n\n- dendron.yml\n```yml\nplugins:\n    onCreate:\n        - id: addEmoji\n        # only add to journals matching daily.*\n        pattern: \"daily.*\"\n        type: js\n    onDelete: ...\n    onChange: ...\n```\n- plugins/addEmoji.js\n```js\nmodule.exports = async function({note}) {\n    note.body += 🌱\n    return note;\n};\n```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n- adding plugins to the note lifecycle can add extra latency to function calls\n- shelling out using `execa` is ugly and really a placeholder until we get url endpoints working\n\n## Future work\n- being able to register arbitrary url endpoints as extensions\n\n## Discussion\n- Submit feedback in our [github discussion](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/680)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/d2f8fe67-36c7-4600-b745-c22bdcb5b2cf.html","relUrl":"notes/d2f8fe67-36c7-4600-b745-c22bdcb5b2cf.html"},{"doc":"8 Multi Publish","title":"8 Multi Publish","hpath":"dendron.rfc.8-multi-publish","content":"\n## Goals\n\nPublish multiple sites using one workspace\n\n### Sub Goals\n\nMake it possible to share links of multiple published sites from one workspace.\n\n## Context\n\nCurrently, to publish a new site, users have to create a new workspace, even if its to publish using the exact same vaults. \n\nSimilarly, if a user wants to reference urls from multiple published sites, they would need to keep multiple workspaces open. \n\n## Proposal\n\nIntroduce a `sites` parameter that is made from multiple [[site objects|dendron://dendron-site/dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#global-configuration]].\n\nWhen a user uses [[Copy Note URL|dendron://dendron-site/dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-url]], Dendron can output one of the following:\n- if the note is part of **one** published site (as determined by `siteHierarchies` and `duplicateNoteBehavior`), we return the url\n- if the note is part of **multiple** published sites, we return a dropdown asking the user to pick a url\n- if the note is part of **zero** published sites, we return an error message \n\n## Details\n\n### Calculating a published site\n\nThis can be bothersome since we need to keep track of all hiearchies that are published and determine if they are unique to a single vault. \n\nFor phase one, we will default to returning a dropdown of all valid urls and having the user choose. \n\n## Example\n\n```yml\nsites:\n    - \n    name: handbook\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - handbook\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: 'https://handbook.dendron.so'\n    title: Dendron Handbook\n    duplicateNoteBehavior:\n        action: useVault\n        payload:\n            - handbook\n    - \n    name: wiki\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: 'https://wiki.dendron.so'\n    title: Dendron Wiki\n    duplicateNoteBehavior:\n        action: useVault\n        payload:\n            - dendron-site\n```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\nWe're introducing more complexity in the configuration for an easier publishing experience. \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8b3bfb16-8330-4a78-85cc-45581c319450.html","relUrl":"notes/8b3bfb16-8330-4a78-85cc-45581c319450.html"},{"doc":"7 Graph Rework","title":"7 Graph Rework","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework","content":"\n## Description\n\nThis RFC contains Multiple Proposals on how to improve the Graph handling of Dendron.\n\n## Goals\n\n-   Functional improvements of the Graph\n    -   View\n    -   Filtering\n    -   Coloring\n    -   Embedding\n-   Performance Improvements\n-   Connection between Graph's\n    -   Multi-Vault\n    -   Other published Gardens and their Graph's see [[RFC 5|dendron.rfc.5-publishing-registry]]\n-   Clarify what is part of the Graph.\n\n## Questions\n\n-   What does the Graph represent?\n-   [[Hierarchies and the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.hierarchy]]bet\n-   [[How are Notes represented in the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.notes]]\n-   [[What role do Schemas play in the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.schemas]]\n\n## Tenets\n\n-   Ownership of the Graph\n-   Functionality\n-   Performance\n-   Entry point to a Decentralized Graph\n-   Connectivity\n\n## Use Cases\n\n-   Graph View improvements\n-   Connection of Graphs\n-   Verification of Graphs against Schemas\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.

Schemas","title":"Graph Rework - Schemas","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.schemas","content":"## Goal\n\nClarify what role schemas play in the Graph.\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, Schemas and the Notes are separated entities with two different structures.\nIn my eyes, a schema should be a Property of a Hierarchy Level.\n\nAs an example, we have the Schema **\"Journal\"**:\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\n\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: Journal\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - daily    \n- id: daily\n  title: Daily\n  children: \n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: \"Year:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"20[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children:\n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: \"Month:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"[0-1][0-9]\"\n  children:\n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: \"Day:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"[0-3][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis Schema would validate a particular Hierarchy pattern lets take the example from the [[Graph Rework - Hierarchy|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.hierarchy]] file to explain it.\n\nWe have the Hierarchy `journal.daily.2020.04.10` that would turn through this Schema into the following structure:\n\n```yml\nJournal:\n  schema: journal\n  children:\n    - daily\nDaily:\n  schema: daily\n  children: \n    - \"2020\"\n\"2020\":\n  schema: year\n  value: 2020\n  children: \n    - \"04\"\n\"04\":\n  schema: month\n  value: 04\n  children: \n    - \"10\"\n\"10\":\n  schema: day\n  value: 04\n  children: []\n```\n\nWhich Schould turn into the following Graph:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    Journal-->|child|Daily \n    Daily-->|child|2020   \n    2020[Year:2020] -->|child|04\n    04[Month:04]-->|child|10\n    10[Day:10]    \n```\n\n## Further Thoughts\n\nThe Schemas should provide a way to use the Value that gets matched from the Pattern it gives, like in this case done for the title.\n\nFurther extensions of this could be to provide multiple patterns.\nAn example here could be the Month schema, to have a group of Schemas that act as one Hierarchy level Month but have different patterns and styles.\n\n```yml\nschemas: \n  - id: month\n    title: \"$element.title\"\n    type: group\n    elements: \n       - January\n       - February\n       - \"...\"\n       - \"December\"\n  - id: january\n    title: \"January\"\n    patterns: \n       - \"january\"\n       - \"January\"\n       - \"01\"\n\n```\n\nEach month gets declared like January is in that Schema.\nHaving that possibility would be extending the possible use cases of Schemas in my Eyes.\n\n## Author\n\nflammehawk:\n\n- [@Github](https://github.com/flammehawk)\n- @Discord fudo#1010","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a155f412-d730-48cc-8893-1bcb7f637206.html","relUrl":"notes/a155f412-d730-48cc-8893-1bcb7f637206.html"},{"doc":"Plan","title":"Plan","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.plan","content":"\n## Goals\n\n![[dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.design#Summary:#Lookup]]\n\n### Core Functionality\n\n-   Functional improvements of the Graph\n    -

If you're looking for the GraphViz export pod, [[you can find its documentation here. | dendron.topic.pod.builtin.graphviz]]\n\n## Summary\n\n<!-- High level overview of solution -->\n\nThe goal of this graph redesign is to create a better-performing, filterable graph view useable by both a published Next.js site and within VSCode.\n\n## Lookup\n\n<!-- Research and similar projects -->\n\n-   [Obsidian's Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view)\n-   [Foam's Graph View](https://github.com/foambubble/markdown-links)\n    -   Also forked from `markdown-links`, so maybe not super useful\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Libraries\n\nIn the interest of balancing development speed and flexibility, the current recommendation is to use [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) for rendering and graph structuring. This is for a couple of reasons:\n\n-   Fully-featured network/graph structuring and rendering\n-   Robust graph manipulation and filtering\n-   Functions as both rendering and graph structuring library\n-   Straightforward documentation\n-   Battle-tested: used in production by both companies and researchers\n-   Future-proof: option to run in headless mode\n    -   Option to use custom rendering logic if needed while still maintaining graph structure and filtering already implemented\n\nHere is the [[list of all libraries researched.|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.library-research]]\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Graph Structure\n\nOne of the benefits of going with a Next.js-centered approach is we get all the benefits of React and global state. Since notes will be loaded into the global Redux store already, querying them and creating the graph structure should be fairly straightforward.\n\n#### Styling\n\nStyling in Cytoscape is done through a style object, which is a CSS-like style array. There are two clear options for styling: either a dedicated CSS stylesheet or a config file with various options. Since the Cytoscape styling method is slightly abstracted from direct CSS, it may be easier to use a config file and lightly parse it into a useable form.\n\n#### Performance\n\nOne of the biggest issues with visualization libraries is performance. While adding many nodes and edges to a graph can degrad`e performance, Cytoscape contains [a number of optimization options](https://js.cytoscape.org/#performance/optimisations) to scale large, complex graphs.\n\nPerformance is determined primarily by the layout algorithm used. The current implementation will use the [cytoscape.js-euler](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-euler) layout, as it is able to display a graph with thousands of nodes and edges in an understandable format.\n\n#### Accessibility\n\n##### Keyboard Navigation\n\nBasic keyboard navigation will be implemented for the new graph view. This will include navigating up and down between hierarchies, cycling between child nodes, and opening notes. Cytoscape offers [a number of events](https://js.cytoscape.org/#events) that can be listened to, making it fairly straightforward to create robust keyboard-driven navigation.\n\n##### Other Notes\n\nMaking a graph truly accessible is a difficult task. Most visualization libraries (including those researched) say virtually nothing about accessibility. While a tradeoff of creating a rich graph may be accessibility, some of the [canvas accessibility ideas shared by Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Hit_regions_and_accessibility) creating possibilities for creating a more accessible graph display.\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n<!-- Tasks that need to be done -->\n\n### Stage 1: Replacing Markdown Links\n\nCreate a more or less 1 to 1 drop in replacement for `markdown-links`, accessible at `/graph` in the Next.js app\n\n-   [ ] Create graph structure in Cytoscape out of Redux-stored notes\n-   [ ] Initialize graph, layout nodes\n-   [ ] Display graph\n-   [ ] Embedding capability in VSCode\n\nAfter this initial integration, work will be done on:\n\n-   [ ] Keyboard navigation/accessibility\n\n### Stage 2: Core Features\n\n-   [ ] Filtering\n-   [ ] Styling\n    -   [ ] Coloring based on schema/hierarchy/etc?\n\n### Stage 3: Secondary Features\n\n-   [ ] Local graph view\n    -   Display on individual note pages, much like Obsidian\n-   [ ] Multi-vault graph view\n    -   Likely most useful for VSCode\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e87249b-358f-4f4b-8049-dff6e6a8463b.html","relUrl":"notes/6e87249b-358f-4f4b-8049-dff6e6a8463b.html"},{"doc":"6 Design System","title":"6 Design System","hpath":"dendron.rfc.6-design-system","content":"\n## Goals\n\nIn order to keep a consistent UI across Dendron apps:\nCreate a design-system of UI components and theme objects, hosted on npm that can be installed and used across all Dendron applications.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n-   When building out a new React based Dendron project, instead of needing to create a components folder and create all your own local components per project, you can instead install ie. `yarn add dendron-design-system` and start building the app using these components like lego blocks.\n\n-   Creating a consistent UI across apps.

Navigating through the eco-system Ant Design newcomer can be overwhelming to decide what the best way to plan your app is.\n\nFor example you have here the [core React Library](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce).\n\n-   But when reading their [theming docs](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme), the first references to sub libraries are already creating the need to make some important decisions.\n\nie Either create all of your theme using the default.\n\n### Theming\n\nAnt Design gives 4 options to [customize-theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) .\n\n1. [Customize-in-webpack](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-webpack)\n2. [Customize-in-Umi](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-Umi)\n3. [Customize-in-create-react-app](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-create-react-app)\n4. [Customize-in-less-file](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-less-file)\n\n#### Customize-in-webpack\n\nThis could actually be the best option as loading directly into webpack is said in the docs to have potential performance improvements.\nhttps://medium.com/@GeoffMiller/how-to-customize-ant-design-with-react-webpack-the-missing-guide-c6430f2db10f\n\nAnd considering that Next.js uses Webpack 5 & [allows for a custom-webpack-config](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config)\n\n#### Customize-in-Umi\n\nThis only seems to be an option if you are using Ant Design Pro, which is their out of the box solution including Routing etc.\n\n#### Customize-in-create-react-app\n\nNot an option as Dendron uses Next.js across the board.\n\n#### Customize-in-less-file\n\nAlso a viable option, but IMO less attractive than loading directly into webpack because\nA) Need to use css less syntax which is not well known among developers today.\nB) Can't use JavaScript Objects for theming which is quite convenient.\nC) Potentially less performant\n\n## `dendron-design-system` Usage\n\n1. Add all theme files with [design tokens](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/design-tokens/) to `dendron-design-system`.\n2. Allow package to be consumeable, either on `npm` or within the Dendron monorepo.\n3. In each dendron Next.js application, import the theme from `dendron-design-system`.\n4. Load The theme into webpack via `next.config.js`\n\nExample:\nPsuedocode (not yet tested)\n\n```javascript\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx\n\nimport {theme} from 'dendron-design-system'\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpack: (config, options) => {\n    config.module.rules.push(rules: [{\n    test: /\\.less$/,\n    use: [{\n      loader: 'style-loader',\n    }, {\n      loader: 'css-loader', // translates CSS into CommonJS\n    }, {\n      loader: 'less-loader', // compiles Less to CSS\n+     options: {\n+       lessOptions: { // If you are using less-loader@5 please spread the lessOptions to options directly\n+         modifyVars: theme,\n+         javascriptEnabled: true,\n+       },\n+     },\n    }])\n\n    return config\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nCurrently W/ Chakra-UI, update to Ant-Design upcoming.\n\nhttps://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/dendron-design-system\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1bb018db-8f8e-46c8-ac4a-4baf4813b0c8.html","relUrl":"notes/1bb018db-8f8e-46c8-ac4a-4baf4813b0c8.html"},{"doc":"6 Dendron Design System","title":"6 Dendron Design System","hpath":"dendron.rfc.6-dendron-design-system","content":"\n\n## Goals\n\nIn order to keep a consistent UI across Dendron apps:\nCreate a design-system of UI components and theme objects, hosted on npm that can be installed and used across all Dendron applications.\n\n## Use Cases\n- When building out a new React based Dendron project, instead of needing to create a components folder and create all your own local components per project, you can instead install ie. `yarn add dendron-design-system` and start building the app using these components like lego blocks.\n\n- Creating a consistent UI across apps.

To that end, we want to make sure that both existing knowledge and newly created knowledge is not just easily accessible but comes with a degree of modularity that it becomes possible to compose existing information and build upon it. \n\nWhen working with code, the concepts of modules and packages are standard in every modern programming language - these abstractions make it possible to package frequently used code into re-usable modules. \n\nThe Dendron Seed Bank is an effort to do the same with knowledge.\n\n## [Lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\n\nPrior work that inspred this RFC\n\n- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Seed Bank needs to define the following components:\n\n1. specs\n   - standard metadata for declaring a module and its dependencies\n   - standard endpoint to retrieve said metadata\n   - standard methods to perform registry operations (add/remove/query)\n2. registry\n   - an endpoint for hosting the registry metadata\n   - an endpoint for performing API calls against the registry\n   - an endpoint for hosting the module artifacts\n3. client\n   - a client that can talk to the registry endpoint\n\n## Details\n\n### Specs\n\nSee [[configuration|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration]] for how metadata is stored in seeds\n\n### Registry\n\nSee [[Registry|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.registry]] for more information\n\n### Client\n\nRegistry client methods will be added to the [[dendron CLI|dendron.topic.cli]] under the `registry` namespace, or `reg` for short. \n\nWe will also add additional methods to the [[workspace command|dendron.topic.cli#workspace-command]] to be able to intiialize a workspace from an existing seed.\n\nSee [[methods|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.methods]] for the list of supported methods\n\n## Motivating Example\n\nYou are interestd in developing your own vscode plugin but don't know where to start. You have a workspace setup already. The following shows how to go about adding a hypothetical `vscode` seed using the CLI (a similar workflow will be availble when using the plugin )\n\n1. Look for any existing seeds to do with vscode using the CLI\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds search vscode\n\n   name: dendron.vscode\n   desc: official vscode docs\n   ```\n2. Add the docs to your workspace\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds add dendron.vscode\n\n   dendron.vscode has been added to your workspace\n   ```\n3. Inspect the schema\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds schema dendron.vscode\n\n   # name of the schema \n   project:\n       nodes:\n           code: \n             quickstart: getting started\n             api: namespace(true)\n             ...\n   ```\n4. Query the notes\n   ```sh\n   dendron note lookup --query code.quickstart\n   ```\n5.

If you want to publish a seed, you can set its [[visibility|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration#visibility]] to `public`.

Your own may be more like a namespaces and being free from.\n\nBut the ones in your Workvaults, have the same Project schema but being more strict. Now you would need to split your Workspace into Work and Personal.\nThe next Problem could be that each Team would want to extend the Work Project scheme with team specific Hierachys which would not really be possible at the moment. \n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal should be in a first step to make it possible to specify if a schema in a vault should have Priority for this vault, making it Possible to have a Schema Vault that contains shared schemas and having schemas inside in each vault that can override the schared Schemas.\n\nThe next Step in this could be to make it possible to extend schemas. Making schemas more useable in general. See [[Reusability|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.reusability]] for this.  \n\n## Proposal\n\nWe can go two ways with this way one would be to just introduce a field `priority` for schemas that, can be `default` to set it as default for all vaults in this workspace and if it is not set it overrides the `default` schema for this vault if it is not set. Other values could be a vault name it applies to or a list of Vaultnames that it applies to. \n\nThe second way could be to intruduce a vault specific config file `dendron.yaml` that has a `schema` field that lists all schemas of the vault with information of their `priority`\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/fa3b1186-b50f-4b7e-9c46-2a116bfdde51.html","relUrl":"notes/fa3b1186-b50f-4b7e-9c46-2a116bfdde51.html"},{"doc":"UI Options","title":"UI Options","hpath":"dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.ui-options","content":"\n## Goal\n\nImproving schema cababilitys to influence the UI Elements of Dendron.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.

The ability to specify Colors that should be used as background in the treeview or as color for the note in the Graphview, but with the ability to specify colors for each VSCodetheme.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n    dendron:\n        id: dendron\n        icon: 'dendron://assets/foo.svg'\n        color:\n            light: lightgreen\n            dark: darkgreen            \n```\n\nYes I was to lazy to adjust each Item under Dendron to the background color.\nSince it is not as straight forward as I have thought. \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-05-16-11-38-06.png) \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/72d4dbde-59f6-463b-bcd8-2de3457af96f.html","relUrl":"notes/72d4dbde-59f6-463b-bcd8-2de3457af96f.html"},{"doc":"Types","title":"Types","hpath":"dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.types","content":"\n## Goals\n\nCreating the possibility to extend the functionality of schemas by introducing a type value on them.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdding a type value to schemas, this value would be optional and default to the current functionality. \nThe current functionality should be named `pattern` in my eyes and be the default value for this key in the yaml. \n\nThese Types should implement a common Interface to be used by dendron, specifying the Keys of the schema Object they handle and Specify a Json Schema to validate against.\nDendron should provide ways for the diffrent types of extensions it recognizes to contribute their own types, that implement the common Interface.\nA type registered this way would be used by `{extensionName}:{typeName}` inside the `*.schema.yaml` files. This allows for flexibility with extending the functionality of Dendron.\n\n\n### Proposed Types\n\nThe following are Types that I would Propose to create as part of dendrons core functionality.\n\n#### Pattern\n\nThis would be the current functionality. The examples show that they are Equal \n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: example\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    pattern: e #defaults to the id if not set\n```\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: example\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    pattern: e #defaults to the id if not set\n    type: pattern\n```\n\n#### Segments\n\nThe purpose of segments could be twofold one would be to merge multiple hierarchy levels into one overall hierachy level. \n\nOr splitting one Hierachy level into multiple levels. \n\n\n##### Example\n\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: date\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    type: segments \n    pattern: $0.$1.$2 # this Key would be optional and default would be to concate the Patterns of the schemas in the elements array, the ${digit} part describes the hierachy lvl in this scheme, but could use named identifiers as well or static pattern parts. A dot represents a Dot in the filename. \n    elements: # required for segments, order matters here if number references are used.    \n      - id: year # this would match the reference $0 or $year\n      - id: month # this would match the reference $1 or $month\n      - id: day # this would match the reference $2 or $day        \n```\n\n\n\n#### Enum\n\nThis type extends the Pattern type with the option to map the matched values of the Pattern to a title that should be used in the UI.\n\nAdditionaly we Could extend it to provide a way to conditionaly change the Children depending on what gets matched. \nExampel being here the pattern for the day to reflect the actual days of the month.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: numericMonth\n     type: enum\n     pattern: (0[1-9])|(1[0-2]) # A valid pattern is required that can match multiple things.\n     matches: # each matchs entry is required to be a valid option for the pattern\n        - 01: Januar # the first part is the matched value and the second part becomes the title\n        - 02: Februar\n        - 03: March  # not every possible match needs to be provided if no match is provided the matched value becomes the title.\n```\n\n\n#### Group\n\nThis type would allow someone to define multiple Schemas for one hierachy level That get grouped under a commen Key.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: Month\n     type: group\n     schemas: # Requires a non empty list of either schema definitions or references. \n        - numericMonth # reference of a defined schema would be valid.\n        - id: shortLetterMonth # can contain the specification of a new schema\n\n```\n\n\n\n#### Heading\n\nThis type is meant to specify the headings of a Note and would apply to Schemas that it is a child of. This should be seen like an interface for the developers. Multiple heading type schemas can exist on one schema. The Order of the Headings in the note is not Relevant. \n\n##### Example \n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: tasklist\n     type: headings\n     children: # each children is either a direct match or a RegEx that must match\n        - open \n        - planned\n        - done\n```\n\n\n\n#### Extension:Type\n\nThis would be how an Extension provided Type could be used.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yaml\nschemas:\n    - id: jiraIssue\n      type: 'jiraPod:issue'\n      # here would then be a list of settings for this type \n      # example could be\n      projectSlug: /[A-Z]{3}/ #The pattern to match the Project slug\n      issueId: /[1-9][0-9]*/ #The Pattern to macht the Id\n      issueState: # The States of the issue \n        - opened\n        - in work\n        - to review\n        - done\n```\n\n### Common Interface\n\nEach Type needs to implement a certain interface providing dendron with functionality to handle the nodes acordingly.\n\n#### Example\n\nJust an example how it could look, feel free to provide other implementation examples.\n```ts\nenum SortingDirections{\n    ascending,\n    decending\n};\nenum DNavigationType{\n    sibling,\n    level\n};\nenum SiblingNavigationDirection{\n    previous,\n    next\n}\nenum LevelNavigationDirection{\n    up,\n    down\n}\ntype NavigationDirection = SiblingNavigationDirection|LevelNavigationDirection; \ntype NavigationFunction<T> = (node:T, direction:NavigationDirection)=>T;\n\ntype SortingFunction<T> = (left:T,right:T)=> number;\ntype MatchFunction<T> = (hierachy:string, args:T)=>boolean;\ninterface Node {} // Placeholder \n\ninterface ISchemaType {\n        \n    getTypeName() : string; // The Name of the Type\n    \n    getSchemaKeys() : string[]; // The Schema Keys that this Type requires for\n    \n    getSortingDirections():SortingDirections[]; // The Sort Directions this Type provides.

This allows you to link and refer to any part of a note, including paragraphs, lists, and tables.\n\n## [Lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\n\nThis section describes existing work that has been done on this topic. \n\n- [roam block references](https://www.roamtips.com/home/what-is-block-roam-research)\n- [obsidian links to blocks](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks)\n\n## Proposal\n\nExtend Dendron syntax to support block references. Obsidian has a great implementation of this already - unless there are critical deficiencies, we should adhere to their implementation and strive for interoperability. \n\n## Concepts\n\n### Block Links\n\nA block link has the following format. It is created in a note that is referencing a piece of text. When navigating the link, users should be taken to the block anchor. \n\n```\n[[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\n### Block Anchor\n\nA block anchor is a `^` character, followed by one or more digits, letters, dashes, and underscores. Dendron should automatically generate these anchors when requested, and users should be able to add in custom anchors. The following are a few examples of anchors:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor amet ^1234\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2 ^second-item\n* Item 3\n\n^whole-list\n\n| Sapiente | accusamus |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Laborum  | libero    |\n| Ullam    | optio     | ^whole-table\n```\n\n`^whole-list`, `^whole-table`, and `^1234` reference the blocks they are attached to. Lists are special though, `^second-item` only references the list item it is next to.\n\n### Block Reference Link\n\nA block reference link is a reference to a block link. \n\n```\n![[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\n#### Block Range References\n\nBlock references should also support [[range references|dendron.topic.refs#block-range-reference]]. Any valid block anchor is also a valid target for the start or end of a range.\n\nWhen referring to block anchors, the range will be inclusive on both ends. For example:\n\n```\nparagraph 1\n\nparagraph 2 ^start\n\nparagraph 3 ^end\n\nparagraph 4\n\n![[#^start:^end]]\n```\n\nThe reference here will include both paragraph 2 and 3. A single paragraph can be referenced without the range.\n\nThe range can also refer to anchors inside lists. When referencing lists, the anchors will include the list items between them.\n\n```\n* Item 1\n* Item 2 ^start\n* Item 3 ^end\n* Item 4\n\n![[#^start:^end]]\n```\n\nThis references the items 2 and 3.\n\n\n## Details\n\n- to create a block, add `#^{id}` to the end of a [[wiki link|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]]\n  ```\n  [[filename#^1234]]\n  ```\n- typing `^` will trigger a search of all blocks that currently exist within the file\n- inputting `enter` will generate a block anchor, a random id, in the target file \n- typing `^^` will trigger a search of all existing block anchors\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] [[Parsing block syntax|dendron.rfc.10-blocks.parsing-block-syntax]]\n- [ ] [[Markdown integration|dendron.rfc.10-blocks.markdown-integration]]\n- [ ] [[Html integration|dendron.rfc.10-blocks.html-integration]]\n- [ ] [[Integration with Vscode|dendron.rfc.10-blocks.vscode-integration]]\n\n## Example\n\n### Block link inside same file\n\n- link to block \n\n```md\nSome notes ^dcf64c\n\n[[#^dcf64c]]\n\nMore notes\n```\n\n- html\n\n```html\n<!-- source -->\n<div id=\"dcf64c\">\n<a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#dcf64c\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\n<p> Some notes </p>\n</div>\n\n<a  href=\"...#^dcf64c\">filename</a>\n\n<div>\n<p> More Notes </p>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Block link to other file\n\n- link to block \n\n  - file a\n\n  ```md\n  Some notes ^dcf64c\n  ```\n\n  - file b\n\n  ```md\n  [[filename#^dcf64c]]\n\n  More notes\n  ```\n\n- html\n\n  - a.html\n\n  ```html\n  <!-- source -->\n  <div id=\"dcf64c\">\n  <a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#dcf64c\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\n  <p> Some notes </p>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  - b.html\n\n  ```html\n  <a  href=\"...#^dcf64c\">filename</a>\n\n  <p> More Notes </p>\n  ```\n\n### Block reference to other file\n\n- link to block \n\n  - file a\n\n  ```md\n  Some notes ^dcf64c\n  ```\n\n  - file b\n\n  ```md\n  ![[filename#^dcf64c]]\n\n  More notes\n  ```\n\n- html\n\n  - a.html\n\n  ```html\n  <!-- source -->\n  <div id=\"dcf64c\">\n  <a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#dcf64c\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>\n  <p> Some notes </p>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  - b.html\n\n  ```html\n  <p>Some notes</p>\n\n  <p> More Notes </p>\n  ```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\n- we are using a purely plaintext based approach of doing block references which means that we are leaving artifacts in the source doc when we generate a block reference\n  - alternatives are using a separate mapping file or using a db, the former adds a layer of indirection that doesn't fit with our current note modal, the latter is currently out of scope\n\n## Discussion\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/95f7193b-9940-42ba-841f-3e2a4d937ba3.html","relUrl":"notes/95f7193b-9940-42ba-841f-3e2a4d937ba3.html"},{"doc":"Vscode Integration","title":"Vscode Integration","hpath":"dendron.rfc.10-blocks.vscode-integration","content":"\n## Tasks\n- [ ] store block ids\n- [ ] searching for blocks inside file\n- [ ] insert block id inside target\n- [ ] searching for existing blocks across all files\n- [ ] navigating to block \n\n\n## Store Block ids\n- a reference of the link must be stored in [[Dendron Engine|pkg.dendron-engine]]\n- currently the engine tracks `notes` and `schemas`\n- each `note` tracks links, we need to add block links to tracking links\n- we need to add an `anchors` field to notes and track block anchors there\n- during initialization, anchors should be kept in a `anchors` dictionary of engine\n\n- lookup\n    - see [[Note Response|pkg.dendron-engine.ref.note-response]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3b52d81b-f5c5-491c-bf9c-58bd0f5826be.html","relUrl":"notes/3b52d81b-f5c5-491c-bf9c-58bd0f5826be.html"},{"doc":"Parsing Block Syntax","title":"Parsing Block Syntax","hpath":"dendron.rfc.10-blocks.parsing-block-syntax","content":"\n\n## Tasks\n- [x] parsing block links\n    * Revised existing link parsing code to recognize block links.

MPE has a huge surface area and we only use a small part of its feature set\n    - MPE is a sizable download (40mb) with performance issues on startup and a few other cases\n    - MPE is based on `markdown-it` whereas dendron is based on `remarkable`\n        - this makes our features sets incompatible and makes a lot of the MPE code base unsuitable for extension\n        - this also causes notes in the preview to render differently from code in the browser\n- use next.js for markdown preview\n    - next.js is already used in Dendron webviews (eg. `Dendron: Configure`) and the plan is to convert all UI components to webviews\n    - next.js lets us add rich visualizations based on React and the latest web technologies\n    - next.js will let us eventually use MDX \n    - next.js can eventually be used as a scaffold for our own web client or dedicated desktop client \n\n## Goals with v1\n- [ ] use next.js to do local preview of dendron notes\n\n### Stretch Goals\n- [ ] scroll sync\n- [ ] use next.js to preview dendron site\n- [ ] better preview for schemas\n\n### Additional Features\n- [ ] folding of headers\n\n## Future Goals\n- use next.js to provide WYSWYG experience for dendron notes\n- incorporate native lookup inside Dendron\n\n## Considerations\n- we currently render notes into HTML for publication with 11ty. it seems like duplicate effort to re-create this in next.js\n    - ideally, want to either serve the static assets from 11ty using next.js or use next.js to generate the static assets\n    - kevin's thoughts: I like to be able to use next.js for everything down the line (static site generation + preview) but it might make more sense presently to implement a vscode specific preview and then figure out how to merge 11ty and next.js afterwards\n- Dendron currently uses express as a backend\n    - we generate static assets from next.js at compile time using `next export` and then serve them over express\n    - Moving forward, if we want to use next.js for preview generation, we will probably need to swap out express with next.js \n    - reason we currently have the next.js/express split is because `next dev` dynamically re-compiles each route one at a time which causes our integration tests to fail (our integration tests call on the APIs from express ) and next.js causes the initial call to fail\n    -

To reference a header, use `![[note#foo]]`. This changes makes our note ref syntax more consistent with our wiki link syntax.\n\nNote that the new ref syntax expects a [[sluggified|dendron.ref.terms#slug]] header. This is done automatically when you use the updated [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command.\n\nThis change makes it possible to create a ref to a header with special characters.\n\nThe old syntax ref syntax will still work but should now be considered deprecated. We will release a `doctor` command to help you auto-upgrade from the old syntax to the new syntax in the coming week.\n\n#### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nIt is now possible to use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable.\n\n<!--\n#### Publishing V2 Integration with Plugin\n\nYou can now both build your notes for publication and preview it from inside vscode.\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#site-build:#dev]]\n-->\n\n### Enhancements\n\n-   `nav_exclude` property excludes from nav sider and table of contents ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.navigation#nav-exclude]])\n-   [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command will use the new note ref syntax\n-   footnote support in preview and when publishing ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#footnotes]])\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n-   spaces in wiki link not rendering in preview\n\n## 0.22.2\n\n### Enhancements\n\n-   better fuzzy search for lookup\n-   publishing v2 enhancements\n    -

Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.\n\nTo address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing.\n\nThere's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [[dendron cli|dendron.topic.cli]]\n\nIn order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest\n```\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`.\n\nWhen you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod\n```\n\nThis will build your site to the path specified by [[siteRootDir|dendron.topic.publishing-legacy.configuration#siterootdir]] in `dendron.yml`.\n\n#### Benchmarks\n\nPublishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll.\n\n-   11ty: 24.45s\n-   jekyll: 220.33s\n\nThere are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases.\n\n#### Gaps\n\n11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:\n\n-   setting a custom color theme\n-   `edit on github` links\n-   `jekyll-seo` functionality\n-   mathjax\n\n#### Migration\n\nAll values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L71:L71`\n\nIf you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:\n\n-   the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`\n-   favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root\n-   `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`\n\n#### Sample dendron.yml config\n\n-   publishing without a cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    siteUrl: \"kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test\"\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n```\n\n-   using custom cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n```\n\n#### Sample repo\n\n-   [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)\n-   [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)\n\n#### CLI Command Reference\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSiteV2\n\nbuild notes for publication using 11ty\n\nOptions:\n  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\n  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]\n  --wsRoot   location of workspace                                    [required]\n  --vaults   location of vault                                           [array]\n  --serve    serve over local http server             [boolean] [default: false]\n  --stage    serve over local http server\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0eq1mz_b-gpdSZVJqruOg.html","relUrl":"notes/0eq1mz_b-gpdSZVJqruOg.html"},{"doc":"0.1.X","title":"0.1.X","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog.0-1-x","content":"## 0.19.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- be able to name remote vaults ([6da3973](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6da39730f735f4700479f002f57d2a7802398ff5))\n- doctor command shouldn't create stubs ([e812f34](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e812f34246d88b007fb45ca03443a74ac27a5e62))\n- help command not working ([02fc08a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/02fc08a907e196b39c23db36b82565c15588673f))\n- nested git repos not showing up in source control view ([37adc5e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/37adc5e528e0b9fa6c86105b39ebb40384023da4))\n- clicking a stub on tree view would show a false error ([ea0e17e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea0e17e7ec8afed44cee1fd0fe442ba4c2064f92))\n\n## 0.19.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Seed Bank\n\n![[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]\n\n#### Support refactor for multi-vault\n\nOne of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out.

You can see an example of this below:\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── bond.one\n└── vault2\n    └── bond.two\n```\n\n- after refactoring `bond -> james`\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── james.one\n└── vault2\n    └── james.two\n```\n\n#### Support Specifying Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\n![[dendron.topic.multi-vault#specify-vault-location-when-creating-a-note,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- add aws to the seed bank ([818bc05](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/818bc0510e3b3b99057ef7cda8d9c61be2b6ebc6))\n- nicer refactor formatting ([0e7749a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0e7749a175a0ce80903cde5c9773649779100a9c))\n- add remote vault to gitignore if exist ([1c252db](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1c252db60c0ea69be8dd10c1768c2dd302711e13))\n- initialize all remote vaults on startup ([1919fe4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1919fe4e6d853d1f6ef63564ebbcc9af1e11a41a))\n- write remote url to dendron config ([2a285ea](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2a285eacaeef8224d2a3530dc991b4977443c039))\n- add github sponsor badge on github repository to recruit more [[environmentalists|dendron.community.roles#environmentalist]] 👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- completion on schema suggestions ([223d6a5](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/223d6a501bd9e51331d28e21d77408b7ca3fba50))\n\n## 0.19.1\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- image preview regex match wrong range \n\n## 0.18.2\n\n### Features\n\n- support image hover ([8fee313](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8fee313785dfc4ac2564f74911a4b51879be0673))\n\n  ```\n  - you can now hover over markdown image links and get the image preview\n  ```\n\n  <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/82119bc9ee184e3ca8e619c3d7e48209\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- faster completion ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- doctor errors when backfilling frontmatter ([862e917](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/862e9173e92a2e5d964273bb87c19e79177a6200))\n- properly parsing links that start at beginning of line ([b2dbdfc](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/b2dbdfc9e49aa1fa74d5097500eeaddf05bf7ccc))\n- limit completion prompts to inside wiki links ([f49972e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f49972ee436f9f637bd68729e702ba2169e68faf))\n- adding local vault with fail if using relative path ([fb202e9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/fb202e91e501cfd5506fd73c9a005807954e48d3))\n- make completion match the whole link ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n- tree view containing out of date hierarchy\n- alias notes will no longer display alias portion as part of the link when publishing\n\n## 0.18.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Support adding remote vaults\n\n- commit: ([d7501b9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d7501b9a5cb116faae64d26798cfd7ccfc73a4b0))\n\nYou can now natively add published Dendron git repos as a _remote vault_ inside Dendron.

Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. \n\nThe configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.\n\nNote that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#configure,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- update config commands ([44dce76](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/44dce76b6fd447cd29a2f4f594632ef758eff927))\n- enable rename with multi-vault ([e26b294](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e26b294e8bbe1e49e44318152c247595e82639bb))\n- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note\n- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui\n- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`\n\n## 0.17.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Automatic Hover's for Links\n\n- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))\n\nYou can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link.

Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.\n\nEach vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.\n\nMulti vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#use-cases,1:#*]]\n\nCurrently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:\n\n- Lookup \n- Deleting a Note\n- Navigating to a note using Tree View \n\nOther commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.\n\nWhen you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.\n\nCurrently known issues (with supported commands):\n\n- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults \n- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View\n\n#### Vault Add Command\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n#### Vault Remove Command\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace.

All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. \n\nAs a reminder, [[server mode|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. \n\nFinally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong.

This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.\n\n##

The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).\n\nServer site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:\n\n- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]\n- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing\n- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)\n- realtime updates for graph extensions\n- custom dendron extensions written in any language \n\nServer side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.\n\n```json\n\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true\n```\n\nNote that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:\n\n- RenameNote\n- Refactor Hierarchy\n- Archive Hierarchy\n- Realtime Schema Updates\n- Pod Commands\n\nYou can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))\n- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion\n- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration\n- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults\n- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs\n- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases\n- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut\n- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut\n\n### Progress\n\n#### Server Migration\n\nThese past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration#tasks,1:#*]]\n\n### Other\n\n- Add overview of [[configuration|dendron.topic.config]]\n- Add proposal for [[custom color tabs|dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs]]\n\n## [0.12.6](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.5...v0.12.6) (2020-10-07)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Default Snippets\n\nDendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets\n\n![[dendron.topic.snippets#default-snippets,1:#*]]\n\n#### Latex Support on Published Site\n\n![[pkg.dendron-jekyll.topic.math#math,1:#*]]\n\n#### Introduce siteRepoDir Customization\n\n![[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#siterepodir,1:#*]]\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- trying to publish the `dendron-template` no longer results in a missing links report\n- issue with schemas not showing up under lookup\n\n### Progress\n\nThis section tracks our progress against the milestones in our [[public roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]\n\n- [x] [[Seeds v0|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.seeds]]\n- [ ] Server migration, progress: 70/100\n  ```\n  - below is a summary of our progress. we are currently about half way done\n  - aiming to have a workable version using the Dendron server by next week\n  ```\n  ![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration#tasks-1,1:#*]]\n\n### Other\n\n#### Seeds\n\n- We launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.\n\nCurrent Seeds:\n\n```\n- open PKM catalogue\n- open AWS catalogue\n```\n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-pkm-catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#Open-AWS-Catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n#### Alternatives\n\nthis announcement also comes with an ask.

The first issue will be sent out later this week!\n\n#### Thank You's\n\nA big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release :man_farmer: :woman_farmer: \nYou can see an overview of all roles [[here|dendron.community.roles]]\n\n- [Preston](https://github.com/LiminalCrab) @Preston#8485 \n  - `+taxonomist`\n  - fix link in dendron schema registry\n- [Tim](https://github.com/timDeHof) @timDehof#6235\n  - `+bugcatcher`\n  - [Cant install Dendron CLI - deployment](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/776)\n- [8Brandon](https://github.com/8brandon) @8brandon#3208\n  - [Design system RFC updated with ANTD](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/101)\n- [Dickson Tan](https://github.com/Neurrone) @Neurrone#4285\n  - `+bugcatcher`\n  - [Dendron should warn users about VSCode errors](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/772)\n- [Darren Brierton](https://github.com/ddbrierton)\n  - `bugcatcher`\n  - [Paste file for non-URI chars](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/765)\n-  [andrey-jef](https://github.com/andrey-jef) @evanAndiez#9559\n  - `+bugcatcher`\n    - Search box (in a dendron publish page, mobile view) disappeared when starting to type \n\n\n### Changelog\n![[dendron.release.changelog#044,1:#043]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/00e6f3d8-4243-42c7-8e4f-a074a1bd0ffb.html","relUrl":"notes/00e6f3d8-4243-42c7-8e4f-a074a1bd0ffb.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes (version 0.43)","title":"Release Notes (version 0.43)","hpath":"dendron.release.2021-05-24","content":"\nDendron 0.43 has sprouted  🌱\n\n### Highlights\n- basic block reference support inside vscode\n- new tree view based on dendron's custom web ui\n- paste file command\n- export your notes as a graphviz file\n- bug fixes\n\n### Community\n\n#### Office Hours\n\nYou can find notes from our latest office hours [[here|dendron.community.office-hours.2021.05.23]]\n\n#### Thank You's\n\nA big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release :man_farmer: :woman_farmer: \nYou can see an overview of all roles [[here|dendron.community.roles]]\n\n- [Jack](https://github.com/imalightbulb) @I'm a lightbulb#6986\n  - [update tag docs on site](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/94)\n  - [add web ui enablement example](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/95)\n\n- [Víctor R.

We **do not and will never** read the data inside **your notes**.\n\nYou can see the full list of information we collect and why we do it in our [[telemetry documentation|dendron.ref.telemetry]] as well as instructions on how to opt out of telemetry.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns, please tell us in our #feedback channel or bring it up during office hours.\n\n### Office Hours\n\nWe are re-starting Dendron office hours! Office hours are a chance for the community to directly engage with the dendron team, ask questions, and give us feedback about how we're doing. We're still playing around with times and format but the first one will be this Sunday at 9:30AM Pacific time.

This iteration was mostly spent on our server migration as well as a series of quality of life improvements across Dendron's core features. You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. \n\n## Highlights\n\n- move to the final phase of the [[server migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] \n  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality \n  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model\n  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [[multi vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]], rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates\n  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward\n  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week\n- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)\n  - initializing large vaults\n  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations \n- better note references\n  - note references can now be nested \n  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`\n- better timestamps (server mode only)\n  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save\n  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label \n- improved publishing\n  - dendron sites now support latex\n  - dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing\n  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link\n  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands\n- consolidated lookup\n  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)\n  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts\n  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup\n\n## Seeds\n\nAside from features, we've also launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. Seeds are **open source dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your 🙏 is welcomed and encouraged. \n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-pkm-catalogue,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-aws-catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n## Sustainability\n\nFinally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** 🌲. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Britt](https://github.com/bs)\n  - [silent log errors](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/277)\n  - various doc updates \n- [onwijsbegeerte](https://github.com/onwijsbegeerte)\n  - [bad export pod placeholder text](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/270)\n- [agichim ](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - [checkbox in preview doesn't render correctly](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/269)\n- [Emaro](https://github.com/Emaro)\n  - [treeview empty in certain cases](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/263)\n- [robothor](https://github.com/robothor)\n  - [issue refactoring with mixed case filenames](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/250)\n\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html","relUrl":"notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-20","content":"Dendron 0.12 is here 🌱\n\nThis week's focus was on publishing. We have a bunch of enhancements and additions to the publishing workflows. We also introduced the [[seeds library|dendron.topic.seeds]], a way of you to remix existing content with Dendron. You can see an example of this [here](http://aws.dendron.so/)\n\nThis release also brings some changes to Dendron's update cycle. \nYou might have noticed that Dendron updates rather aggressively 🚀🚀🚀\n\nOur current release cycle is a patch update every day and a minor release every week. \nMoving forward, we will be doing patch updates every few days and a minor release every two weeks. \n\nThe move to this new release cycle is a reflection that Dendron is growing rapidly and starting to mature. \n\nWe will be working on some major changes in October to stabilize the core feature set and make them easier to use. We will also be shifting our underlying architecture from a VSCode plugin to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) which will result in a richer feature set and the ability for Dendron to be more easily integrated into additional editors.\n\nAs part of this update, we've put out the first version of the [Dendron principles](https://dendron.so//notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html) which reflects our design philosophies and the direction we are taking Dendron. \n\nThis is a work in progress so feel free to make suggestions and comments in the discord.\n\nI've mentioned this before but we will also be releasing our formal roadmap by the end of the month. This roadmap will cover all major projects we plan on doing in 2020. \n\nWe are looking to come out of preview by the end of October and do a formal 1.0 release before the end of the year. \n\nI want to take this moment to again thank everyone for being part of our journey to build a better tool for managing knowledge 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 \n\nI believe we're are planting something special here and am excited to see us grow 🌱 \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n* * *\n\n## Cli\n\n### Support for seeds\n[[dendron.topic.seeds]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Standardize on core cli flags across all commands\n- More options when planting seeds\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Rename when stub is present \n\n## Lookup\n\n### Lookup new notes with Selection\n\n![[dendron.topic.lookup.create#creating-notes-with-a-selection,1]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Lookup can extract highlighted text\n\n## Pods\n\n### Implement Json import pod\n\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.json]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- All filepaths can be set relative to the workspace root\n- Json pod can import filenames as links\n- Standardize interface for import/export pod commands\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Handle stub notes correctly on import \n\n## Publishing\n\n### Publish command\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#publish,1:#*]]\n\n### Copy note url command\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-url,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Support relative path for all file paths\n- Set custom path for publishing repo\n- Keyboard shortcuts for copy note url cmd\n- Be able to pass in custom args to commands\n- Support incremental page building\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Copy url truncates `//` \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Denis Sikuler](https://github.com/gamtiq)\n  - update docs\n\n- [agichim](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - update docs\n\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n  - bug with copy note url\n\n- [Jack](https://github.com/JackQAQ-byte)\n  - issue with images on published sites\n\n- [Tom](https://github.com/peanutputter)\n  - [issue with image paths](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/200)\n\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n  - [writeup on files vs folders](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html","relUrl":"notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-13","content":"![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/comic.1.png)\n\n- My wife, Ilana Lin, drew a comic for this week's release.

Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. \n\nIn that time, we've built an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days 🌱 and become a part of our budding community. \n\nSpeaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fayçal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾\n\nDendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you. If you've spent any time in our discord, you've probably already had chats with one or both of the folks I just mentioned.\n\nThat's all for last week's release. Stay tuned for some big announcements later this week :) \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Development\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Bad import causes dendron to not compile in case-sensitive file systems \n\n## Engine\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix bad sibling traversal cases \n- Issue with mixed case file names \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Support offset with note refs ([[docs|dendron.topic.refs]])\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Note refs will not be resolved when inside an inline code span or a fenced code block \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix issue with preview checkbox not updating markdown \n- Fix issue with backslash causing in certain markdown blocks \n\n## Pods\n\n### Support note references when Publishing Notes ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing]])\n\nDendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note.

[Kiran Pathakoda](https://github.com/kpathakota) has been one of the first to adopt Dendron as his primary note taking platform and will be helping out with the development of Dendron.\n\nIn practice, this means Kiran will be hanging around the discord, help triage issues, and help me put together a more comprehensive public roadmap for the project!\n\nIf you're interested in being more involved with the development of Dendron (and this doesn't have to involve coding), feel free to ping me on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so).\n\nThere are a bunch of really exciting things that will be coming out over the next couple of weeks and we will need all the dendrologist we can get :) \n\n### New Channels\n\n- \\#dev: discuss all things related to Dendron development\n- \\#schemas: share and discuss schemas\n- \\#workflows: how do you take notes?\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Jochen Burkhard](https://github.com/herop)\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n- [Denis Di Fazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- [nixsee](https://github.com/nixsee)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html","relUrl":"notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-23","content":"Schemas and pods were the focus of this week's efforts. \n\nSchemas are now both more powerful and re-usable with a custom `pattern` attribute as well as the ability to `import` existing schemas. As a bonus, you can also visualize your schemas using the `Show Schema Graph` command!\n\nOn the Pod site, we've made the process of publishing a pod more flexible with per hierarchical configuration options, a unified config syntax and automatic reloading of your config on every publish. \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Bundled extensions\n\n### Add ShowSchema Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html#dendron-show-schema-graph))\n\nYou can now view your schemas using the same graph visualization as you do your notes!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graphs.show-schema.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron schema graph will show schemas by their title. if not set, revert to id. \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Markdown parsing can now be up to 300% faster publishing a site \n\n## Notes\n\n### Create Daily Journal Note Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202.html#daily-journal))\n\nThe daily journal helps you keep a journal for each day of the year. By default, it will create the journal under `daily.{date}` though this is configurable by setting the `dendron.dailyJournalDomain`.\n\nYou can create a daily journal using `> Dendron: Create Daily Journal Note` or `CMD+SHIFT+I` shortcut.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/notes.daily.gif)\n\n## Pods\n\n### Support different defaults on a per hierarchy basis when publishing ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#config))\n\nYou can now set different publishing defaults for each hierarchy (as well as general defaults for your entire vault.)\n\nAs an example, below is the config for [my website](https://kevinslin.com). It publishes everything under the `home` and `blog` hierarchies but will only publish notes under `books` if `published: true` is set on the frontmatter. \n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\nsite:\nsiteHierarchies: [home, blog, books]\nsiteRootDir: docs\nconfig:\n    books:\n    publishByDefault: false\n```\n\n### Implement new website config syntax ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#properties))\n\nNew config syntax unifies a bunch of different configuration options and renames others to more sensible names.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Auto migrate old-style site config to new style site config \n- Always read config before publishing. no more reloading the workspace after updating dendron.yml! \n- Update site config on dendron starter template \n- Use rsync to copy assets when building pods \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Use regular copy command if rsync not installed \n- Links not being converted to ids when publishing \n\n## Schemas\n\n### Support schema import ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#imports-optional-str))\n\nIt's now possible to import schemas! This means you can now create composable schemas from re-usable pieces.\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\nparent: root\nchildren: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### Support match by pattern ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#pattern))\n\nYou can now explicitly specify a glob pattern for any level of your schema. If not set, defaults to the schema `id`.\n\nThe following is an example of a schema for `journal` hierarchy. \n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\ntitle: journal\ndesc: \"\"\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - year\n- id: year\ntitle: year\npattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - month\n- id: month\ntitle: month\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - day\n- id: day\ntitle: day\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nnamespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Set schema title to id if not set \n- Better error message on bad schema \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Autocomplete correctly on imported schema \n\n## Workspace\n\n### Fixes\n\n- A misconfigured POSIX path causes dendron to not load on windows \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Devashish](https://github.com/ric03uec)\n- [Howard](https://github.com/runlevelrobot)\n- [komoda102](https://github.com/komoda102)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-16","content":"This is one of our biggest releases yet!

This is a super short 3min survey that will help me plan the future growth of Dendron.\n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Commands\n\n### Add Rename Note Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#rename-note))\n\nDo you have regrets? While there are some things that you can't take back, misnaming a note should never be one of them. Dendron now lets you rename files and will update all links in all files that link to it!\n\n![rename](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/command-rename.gif)\n\n### Add Copy Note Link Command ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#copy-note-link))\n\nSchool's out so it's okay to copy notes. Use this to get the wiki-link (with title) of the current open note.\n\n![copy note link](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/command.copy-link.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Show feedback on copy note link \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Issue with renamed notes not being indexed \n- Issue where `doctor` doesn't backfill newly created notes'\n\n## Notes\n\n### Flexible Configuration for Notes ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202.html#configuration))\n\nNotes are now as flexible as your yoga teacher. You can now customize every aspect of your `Journal` and `Scratch` notes - how they are added, their time format and even what they're called\n\n### Add Built in Snippets ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html))\n\nAll the one-liners and bad jokes that you have saved for that special someone? Type them out faster than ever with built-in snippets. This updates the default settings to allow tab-based snippet completion and also initialize new vaults with some default snippets. \n\n![snippets](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tab-autocomplete.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Copy on Create: Journal and Scratch notes will automatically copy their links to the clipboard after creation\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Scratch note title note being set properly \n- Not all notes indexed in sparse vaults: There was an issue where certain notes without a full hierarchy would not be indexed by Dendron. That issue has now been eliminated.\n- Notes created via link not being indexed properly: Issue where sometimes new notes created using link navigation wasn't being indexed. \n\n## Pods\n\n### Custom Blogging Layout ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/4c0ef322-3006-405c-9a66-3134dd9649a5.html#blogging))\n\nSometimes you have something you just need to shout out from the rooftops. Because its likely people think that you are a crazy person if you did this, Dendron now has dedicated blogging layouts so you can blog instead! \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Issue with buildpod logging \n\n## Schemas\n\n### Apply Schema Description to New Notes ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#desc))\n\nSchemas now automatically apply their description to newly created notes that match said schema. Because life is too short to annotate all your notes all the time. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Remove data field from new schemas: Schema notes only show you fields that are required on creation. \n\n## Workspace\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Update index when notes are deleted outside of dendron: We know that sometimes, it can't be helped and you'll need to work with your notes outside of Dendron. If that work is deleting notes, Dendron will now keep track of it and remove it from its lookup index as well!\n\n## Other\n\n### Make Dendron available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/9134f160-31a6-4ab0-a640-1fce466f9526.html#open-vsx))\n\nMaybe you just don't like Microsoft. Maybe you want to see other people. Whatever the reason, Dendron is now available on all VSCode compatible editors like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to all these people that contributed issues and suggestions during this release.\n\n- [Josh Finken](https://github.com/jfinken)\n- [denisdifazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- Annegrim\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a020e2.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a020e2.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.5)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.5)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-02","content":"With the coming of August, 2020 is officially on the wane.

Happy gardening! 🌱\n\nWith this release, we are also conducting our first dendron user survey. It's a short survey that should take no more than 3 minutes to fill out and will help inform me on the future growth of Dendron. Your participation is immensely appreciated 🙏\n\n<https://forms.gle/PPqe2axvwEmpXj4v5>\n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Legend\n\n- 🚧 experimental feature\n\n## Commands\n\nDendron has a series of built-in commands. They are all prefixed with `Dendron:` and can be accessed through the [command prompt](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#command-palette).\n\n### Add Doctor Command\n\n([d4fa71c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d4fa71cd839782587d47a3ba1b0f7e89742e7ffe)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#doctor))\n\nThis makes sure your workspace is up to date. It will execute the following actions:\n\n- add ids and titles to the frontmatter of all notes that are missing it\n- setup a `docs` folder if it doesn't exist. Required if you want to [[publish|dendron.topic.publishing]] your notes\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/bd045f708f8e474193de8e3de0dc820f\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/bd045f708f8e474193de8e3de0dc820f-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Add ShowHelp Command\n\n([ecf3c68](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ecf3c6822848834d9a00e373d1c59b6628e7f4df))([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#show-help))\n\nDendron will open your current browser to the [[quickstart|dendron.tutorial.recap]] page. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/b81ce02f30b84d79b92584f339184a00\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/b81ce02f30b84d79b92584f339184a00-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Pods\n\nPods are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n### 🚧 Support Publishing Notes\n\n([e063732](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e063732d1ff082dd8520a479926e7ceb1b0893ab)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html))\n\nDendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). \n\n### Features\n\n#### Nested Hierarchies\n\ndendron-Jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif\" />\n\n#### Lookup\n\nIf you'd rather not click, dendron-Jekyll also supports path-based lookup.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif\" />\n\n#### Permanent Ids\n\nEvery page is published using its unique ID which means that URLs will never change, even if the filenames do.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg\" />\n\n#### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs\n\nIf you have a free GitHub account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg\" />\n\n#### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables\n\n- NOTE: this will only be \"compiled\" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif\" />\n\n#### Selective Publication\n\nYou can choose to publish your whole vault or a single domain within your vault. \n\n- NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).\n\n### Setup initial workspace to be ready for publishing\n\n([e1242b4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1242b494cc91b3284053b54dccecc4e4686ab7d))\n\nAll workspaces created from Dendron `0.5` onwards will have all the necessary configuration pre-loaded for publishing. \n\n## Schemas\n\nThink of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\n### Enable lookup for Schemas\n\n([19b4677](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/19b46770fe6a842831692563de96ff4a823df871)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#schemas))\n\nThe process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all. \n\nFind Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\nCreate Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-create.gif)\n\nDelete Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-delete.gif)\n\n### Schema Templates\n\n([0205d66](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0205d66fc4538361322ffeabb3e532f0d541b775)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates))\n\nSchema templates let you specify a pre-defined template that will automatically be applied to all notes that match the template. You can see a video of how this works below.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Simpler Schema Syntax\n\n([d53ddb](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d53ddb73bfacc3f769db88cfd4f482a706dcb6dd))\n\nSchema syntax has been simplified. Before we had an extra `data` field to namespace the `namespace` field. We flattened all schema attributes to make the syntax more elegant. Note that the old styled `data` syntax is still supported but we recommend moving to the new syntax as `data` will be deprecated in a few releases.\n\n## Fixes\n\nBugfixes for this release\n\n- Fix issue with Journal Names on Windows ([d0bfe7f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d0bfe7fb0288e8610fc4b177ee85697a8ebc3efe))\n- Stub nodes should keep parents when deleted ([f32f291](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f32f291bc7a1ddd6c542483730e2db74b400dafa))\n- Issue with Urls in published site ([0ac8e75](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ac8e75c95a9c4760e12bb301fc5b66b011ef0fb))\n\n## Enhancements\n\n- CI/CD testing ([d6ce68c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d6ce68c720d7e8c96d7f4bb6ab390c1bd52c5218))\n  - Dendron now has continuous integration tests for all pushes. ![](https://travis-ci.com/dendronhq/dendron.svg?branch=master)\n  - Tests run on mac, linux and windows which means moving forward, there should be fewer OS (aka Windows) related issues \n- Update [quickstart docs](http://localhost:4000/notes/e86ac3ab-dbe1-47a1-bcd7-9df0d0490b40.html)  to showcase new features ([aec0fe0](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/aec0fe0939239d84f5b7ebd9ebae57a09bcdae43))\n\n## Next\n\nA teaser of some items we are working on for the next release.

It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.\n\nA workspace has a `dendron.yml` file that specifies its [[vaults|dendron.ref.vaults]].\n\n## Commands\n\n### Workspace: Add and Commit\n\nAdd and commit all notes across all vaults to git.\n\n### Workspace: Sync\n\nSynchronizes all notes across all vaults with git. Any changes you made will be pushed back to remote, and any changes in the remote will be pulled.\n\nIn more detail: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This workflow is good in most cases: private notes, internal shared vaults, or your personal writings. This workflow doesn't work as well in some cases however, so we offer per-vault configuration options which you can use to adjust how your notes are synchronized.\n\nYou can set these configuration options in your `dendron.yml`, either for each vault with the `sync` option, or for all [[workspace vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#workspace-vault]] with the `workspaceVaultSync` option. The configuration will look like this:\n\n```yml\n... rest of your dendron.yml\nworkspaceVaultSync: noPush\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: my-website\n        sync: noCommit\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-website.git'\n    -\n        fsPath: my-notes\n        sync: sync\n        type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-notes.git'\n```\n\n#### configuration options\n\n##### sync\n\nDendron will try to synchronize everything: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This is the default for regular vaults.\n\n##### noCommit\n\nPull and push updates if the workspace is clean, but don't commit. You manually commit your local changes, but automatically share them once you committed. This is good for vaults where you want to write a meaningful commit message and control what is being committed, for example a shared knowledge base or wiki. This is the default for [[Workspace Vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#workspace-vault]].\n\n##### noPush\n\nCommit any changes and pull updates, but don't push. You can watch the repository and make local changes without sharing them back. This is good if you want to watch the updates in a vault and maybe even note your own thoughts in the vault without sharing them, for example an organization handbook that you don't want to edit yourself.\n\n##### skip\n\nDon't do any synchronization. This may be useful if you use some other tool to synchronize this vault.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c4cf5519-f7c2-4a23-b93b-1c9a02880f6b.html","relUrl":"notes/c4cf5519-f7c2-4a23-b93b-1c9a02880f6b.html"},{"doc":"Web UI","title":"Web UI","hpath":"dendron.ref.web-ui","content":"\n## Summary\n- status: [[Experimental 🧪|dendron.ref.status#experimental-🧪]]\n\nThe Dendron Web UI refers to Dendron's native UI components build using the latest web technologies (instead of VSCode components).\nThis lets us create dynamic interfaces with dynamic dropdowns, drag and drop and custom made components. \n\n## Quickstart\n\nTo get started, set [[enableWebUI|dendron.topic.config.dendron#enablewebui]] to true and then reload your workspace to enable.\n\n## Components\n\n### TreeView\n\nThis is an implementation of the [[Dendron Tree View|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]] using the Dendron Web UI. \n\n### Dendron Calendar View\n\nThe Dendron Calendar View lets you view your daily journal in calendar form.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f506aab0f6eb44fc8cd4dc79a367a309\"><img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/f506aab0f6eb44fc8cd4dc79a367a309-with-play.gif\"></a>\n\nThe Dendron Calendar View has the following capabilities:\n\n- Clicking on a given day date will open the corresponding dayil journal note\n- Clicking on a given day without a daily journal note will create one\n- Days without daily journal note are grayed out and days that contain an entry are displayed in white.\n- Shows indicators in the form of dots (max 5) to reflect the word count of that entry.

A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a _vaults_ folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── vault.main\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   ├── foo.one.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault.secret (hypothetical)\n        ├── secret.one.md\n        └── secret.two.md\n```\n\nBy default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Vault Add\n- shortcuts: none\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace.\n\nWhen you add a vault, you can choose between adding a local vault or a remote vault.\n\n#### Local Vault\n\nA local vault is a folder in your file system.\n\n#### Remote Vault\n\nA remote vault is a git repository. If you choose a remote vault, you can choose from a vault from the registry or enter a custom git url.\n\nWe currently have four vaults in the registry: `dendron.so`, `aws.dendron.so`, `tldr.dendron.so and `xkcd.dendron.so`. These correspond to the notes backing https://dendron.so/ and https://aws.dendron.so/ respectively.\n\nNote that when you add a remote vault, the url can also point to a remote workspace. In that case, dendron will inspect the `dendron.yml` to get a list of all vaults within the workspace and add all vaults from inside the workspace.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Vault Remove\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nRemove a vault\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace.

Its a vault that is local to your file system.\n\n### Remote\n\nA remote vault is what you get when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a remote vault. This is a vault that is cloned from a git repo. It should be a similar format as what you see below\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: dendron\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/dendron.git'\n```\n\nWhen someone pulls down a workspace with a `dendron.yml` that contains a remote vault, Dendron will automatically initialize the vault at the given `fsPath`. If the vault is a [[Workspace Vault|dendron.ref.vaults#workspace-vault]], Dendron will pull downt the workspace to `{workspaceName}/fsPath`. \n\n## Vault Types\n\n### Regular Vault\n\nA regular vault is what you get by default when you first initialize your workspace. \n\n### Workspace Vault\nA workspace vault is a vault that belongs to another [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. It is automatically created when you run [[Vault Add|dendron.ref.vaults#vault-add]] on a [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. Upon adding a workspace, Dendron will add all the vaults of the given workspace inside your `dendron.yml` \n\nYou can see an example of the configuration [[here|dendron.ref.vaults#remote-workspace-vault]].\n\n## Configuration\n\n### fsPath\n- file path to vault\n\n### name\n- default: last component of `fsPath`\n\nvault name \n\n### visibility\n- choices: \"private|public\"\n\nIf set to private, notes in this vault will not be published regardless of any other configuration. This takes precedences over everything. \n\n### workspace\n- required: false\n\nIf set, specifies the workspace that this vault belongs\n\n### remote\n- added property for [[remote vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]]\n- properties\n    - type: currently only `git` is supported (in the future, we might add additional types)\n    - url: url to github repo\n\n\n### sync\n- default: `sync`\n\nSee [[workspace sync configuration options|dendron.ref.workspace#configuration-options]] for valid options.\n\nSets the [[synchronization strategy|dendron.ref.workspace#Workspace: Sync]] for this vault. This overrides the [[workspace vault sync option|dendron.topic.config.dendron#workspaceVaultSync]] if it is set.\n\n### Configuration Examples\n#### Local Vault\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    └── vault\n\n```\n\n#### Remote Vault \n```yml\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: dendron-vault\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/dendron-vault.git'\n        name: dendron\n        sync: sync\n    -\n        fsPath: yc-vault\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/yc-vault.git'\n        name: yc\n        sync: noPush\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    |── dendron-vault\n    └── yc-vault\n\n```\n\n#### Remote Workspace Vault\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: handbook-vault\n        workspace: handbook-workspace\n        name: handbook\nworkspaces:\n    handbook:\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/handbook.git'\n\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    └── handbook-workspace\n        └── handbook-vault\n\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4.html","relUrl":"notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Onboarding Transcript","title":"Dendron Onboarding Transcript","hpath":"dendron.ref.transcript","content":"0:00  \nSo getting started? And have you had a chance to play around with engine at all, or this is the first time.\n\n0:07  \nUm, I've opened it and read a little bit of the doc in it. And that's all I've done.\n\n0:13  \nOkay, cool. That's perfect. And so right now,\n\n0:17  \nwhen you turned up in the, in the, in the couple of discord threads was really the first point that I looked at it at all, and I haven't spent much time looking. And then you throw this out, like, Okay, this jumpstart.\n\n0:33  \nCool. Yeah. And that's kind of what this onboarding is for. It's, it's, you know, today's help, even if you haven't even opened it up just to give you the idea of, you know, why you might want to. And so right now, what you're looking at is identity and workspace, and the way so let's back up and tension. We manage your notes and our work states and if you use VS code, it's the equivalent of the VS code workspace. So that's a one to one match in there. And the way that you start off is you can initialize the workspace. And right now, I did me, we can just make a new one, like lead you. And so this is saying the workspace should be at this location. And so when we create a workspace, we can either create one with intention tutorial notes, and that has right or you can do an empty one. So I'm just going to do an empty one in this case. And so when you create an empty workspace, you have one file, which is the root file. And this is just there for this is kind of like your phone. And the way that denture and works is if you want to create a file, you can just type command L. I'm going to toggle screencast mode, command l triggers to look up bar, and most of the things you'll do in engine will involve this one have you used tools like Notational Velocity no So Notational Velocity, it's it was a tool where basically when you are looking for a file, for example, if I type Python, if the file doesn't exist, then it creates it for you. If it does, if that if it does exist, it will fetch it. So it's this idea that you never really have to think about\n\n2:22  \nthe accessing your data.\n\n2:26  \nAnd\n\n2:27  \nso I'm assuming that dendron is putting the is that a YAML? header?\n\n2:33  \nYes, that is a yamo header.\n\n2:35  \nSo it's just automatically doing that when it creates the file.\n\n2:39  \nExactly.\n\n2:41  \nAnd for the yamo header, the idea here is we store some metadata. So every node has a unique ID. And the reason we do that is because if you choose to you can publish your notes. That's my local version that this is the engine website is actually a published vault.\n\n2:59  \nAh, Why. So I created a\n\n3:03  \nworkspace with the with the help notes. Yeah. So that's why it looks the same.\n\n3:10  \nYep, exactly. And it is generated from the notes. And the reason and if you notice the IDs for each note, when you publish the notes are actually published by their ID not by the name. And what's nice about that is even if you've renamed the notes, as long as you keep the frontmatter, it will show publish to the same URL.\n\n3:29  \nInteresting,\n\n3:30  \nokay. And, okay, so, and as I'm battling off, if at any point, you want to just like stop me and say, like, hey, like, what's this? What would you guess? Do you just feel free to I tend to otherwise just keep talking?\n\n3:42  \nOh, no, that's fine. That's exactly what I was hoping. Okay,\n\n3:45  \nokay. Um, so creating, so as far as creating notes, you can type it. If it exists, it'll fetch it. If it doesn't then it it will create a another way of creating notes as using wiki links, which is double bracket syntax. So for example, if I wanted to go to Ruby, I could type in Ruby. And then if you do the go to definition shortcut, then you can go to default on Mac is something different. I just changed it to Ctrl, enter. So if I do Ctrl, enter, I can go into Ruby, sometimes some markdown preview, well, like, not update right away. But in, for example, in groovy, I can type in Python, and I can go here and I can go back to Python. And making these links, it's kind of the same thing as look up in like JavaScript, for example, JavaScript doesn't exist. But if I navigate to it, then venturing well creatively.\n\n4:42  \nThat's kind of the same way obsidian works.\n\n4:47  \nAnd it's just this idea that you shouldn't be thinking about the order of files. It's, you know, not likely and notetaking should just be the information that you're working with. And as far as bi directional linking On the left hand panel, so we have a backlink section. And the backlinks section shows you all the notes that this note is linked by. And so in Python, it's showing you that hey, Ruby links do Python. Yep. And I think obsidian has a similar panel, but it's, yeah, it's a backlink panel. Now, the thing that Oh, and I guess one more thing before I get into hierarchies, we support let's see, this is header one.\n\n5:35  \nThis is header Two,\n\n5:39  \none.\n\n5:43  \nSo denisha. We also support what we call defences, loan costs and block graph. I think loan costs and block references. We call them nodes references. I think obsidian also has a doe I'm not sure what they call it.\n\n5:58  \nI don't actually have this Same. There are references to headers and things, but they don't. It's a little different.\n\n6:07  \nRight? So what I'm going to show you is in dendron, you can embed notes and other notes. So for example, I just hit Command Shift R, which copy the left lens of this note, and the, and then I can paste it, for example in JavaScript. And so I'm seeing the Python notes embedded in the JavaScript note. You can either choose to reference a note, or you can choose to reference a header. So for example, everything starting from heading one, and you can also do games. So you can say everything starting from header one to header two, that you can embed notes into other nodes. And then the other thing that you can do is you if you keep bullets, the markdown preview is mutable in the sense that you can click on the lead and also update the markdown. Yes, that's a little thing that I find people get quite excited about that\n\n7:08  \nover if you're going to use to do if you're going to use those\n\n7:10  \nas to dues it's a big deal. Exactly. Um, okay, and now getting to the part. So right now what I've shown you it's pretty similar to obsidian it's pretty similar to go more like how normal note taking apps work. The things that dungeon the dungeon now starts doing differently is we're focused on having your notes conform to some sort of structure. And so that's not to say like, as you can see, like we support backlinks so you can link any note to any note. But the problem that I found and the reason why I made my own note taking tool is I find that once you get a lot of notes, you need some sort of structure, if you organize it, if it's all backlinks, like it becomes really hard to find something, whether it's a naming convention, whether it's some sort of hierarchy, like there need to be some sort of structure to help you find it. And so in Benjamin, for us that structure is hierarchy. So the way that you create a hierarchy, and Benjamin is whatever. So when you do command L, you the lookup bar gets populated by the current note that you're in. And so if you have not, then you're creating a new level in the hierarchy. So for example, I can do Python data. And so you know, this is a data node. But the hierarchy is, Python is parents data as a child. And under data, for example, I might want to do if I'm learning about Python, data could be you know, all of the various data structures that Okay, my path and setting I can look in billions and things. And the nice thing about this hierarchy is now instead of, you know, you manually having to link all the nodes together, because you are in the Python hierarchy, you can you have a bird's eye view of everything in this hierarchy.\n\n8:59  \nThat's just kind of Gaining\n\n9:02  \ninterest. Another way you can see the hierarchy is we have to show graph command. And so just like how obsidian has a graph, Python, now Python engine has a graph. But this is a graph with backlinks. It's a graph of your hierarchy. And so, you know, as you note, like there isn't a connection between Ruby and Python, even though there's a backlink, what this is showing you, you can think of it as a top down view of your table of contents of the hierarchies that you have. Right. Now, the nice thing about having this is like right now, for example, Python this in stone thing, that web engine lets you do, so let me back up for a moment. hierarchies, I find are one of the best ways of organizing notes by most people and most tools don't really support it as well. And that's because I think not because hacky some work, but because he had no tooling on our piece. Like if you had your files in a folder Actually, you could put them in a bunch of different folders, but then like finding them is more difficult. And then if you ever wanted to rename anything, that's just a nightmare. And so attention, we're building on this idea that it is actually some of the most effective ways of managing information with people. And we it's built around this idea that as hope you work with hierarchies, and one thing we let you view is we let you be factor. So for example, right now, I'm under a Python. But let's say that I shut off a entering text I want to replace. So I'm saying for Python instead of Python. Oops, let me again, instead of Python, go place Python with Lang Python. And what this is going to do is everywhere where you have python.md, it's going to add the Lang prefix for programming language. And if I hit proceed, proceed. What you'll notice is that not only did all the falaschi name but also If I go, for example, into movie, all the links to the palace, and also then. And so it's just an easier way of managing the hierarchies. And now, like, why might you want to do this? Well, because I have this just crazy thing. So because I have this programming language it, what it lets me do. And this is really what I started doing with my notes is, if I'm learning, for example, a programming language, and I'm working on like two or three at a time, it's really difficult to context switch between them. It's like, how do we do this in Ruby, how you listen to Python? What I found was much more conducive is if I could think like, okay, in a programming, what is my model for programming language. And so for example, a programming language has data structures, and so I could apply that to Ruby as well. So for example, for Ruby, it also has data structures. And then what I could do is when I'm learning about Ruby, you know, I could translate that higher He that I learned from Python, and put it into a movie. And what this lets me do now is, now it's a lot easier to context switch between different programming languages, because I'm thinking more about the concepts than the actual implementation. And for example, now, if I'm like in my hierarchy for So first of all, like, if I'm looking at data structures in Python, I have all of them in one view. But now let's say that I want to look up data structures for all my programming languages, then I also have a similar view for that. And so now, this idea, and this is where it really, for me, like, became like, the way that I did all my notes is having these hierarchies not only are they a great organizational scheme, because now instead of having 100, you know, 1000 notes at the top level, you only have, you know, the very good stuff behind this. So it's programming languages. It's cooking as you know. Few things that you care about at the top level, and you can drill down into them. And when you drill down into them, it's not just organizational. It's something that, for me, at least, it helps me learn about the topic. Because I find the heipiess that I create, for, you know, a programming language or anything, they affect my mental model of it. And I find over time, when I'm learning about things, it's not actually the implementation that matters, but it's the fact that I've been able to develop this hierarchy and then continue refining it over time.\n\n13:34  \nThat makes sense. Well, there's nothing that keeps you from just having a bunch of loose notes at some, somewhere even if, even if it's nothing. If for the sake of cleanliness, you you create a hierarchy starting with Miss and stuff under it. You have the same thing you have typically totally get the language thing. I once had a situation where I had the word two computer assembly languages. Yeah. And one of them had right to left operation on the instructions. And the other had left to right, but three quarters and now, three quarters of the names of operations were the same. So you just had to remember whether you were in left, right or right, left. So yeah, I totally get that.\n\n14:28  \nAnd the other thing that I do for these notes, and let me just going to show you this is my one of my vaults. This is a notes for a meeting today. But for example, I have a CI and this is like all the CI commands that I run into, and it's not just necessary. Oh, okay. So that one. It's like, if I run into a problem instead of, you know, googling it,\n\n14:55  \nyeah.\n\n14:56  \nI don't know how half a cache of it. So if I run into the same problem, they And, you know, I can just go into that COI hierarchy.\n\n15:04  \nAnd right because it's the one, it's the one. I did that last month. I know I know that, but I don't remember.\n\n15:12  \nExactly. And if you look at this, I think I have a couple of hundred different commands. And the nice thing about this as like, I did none of this, you know, ahead of time, it was kind of a just in time, I ran into cognitive work. I needed to Stack Overflow, it took me 10 minutes. I never want to spend time on it again. Let me go into, you know, yeah.\n\n15:36  \nOkay, cool.\n\n15:38  \nSo, can we look a little bit at, um, kind of your to dues?\n\n15:44  \nYeah. So, two dues let me actually, okay, I'm going to do two things. I'm first going to show you how you would create it from scratch and then I'll show you my two dues for the day. I like to organize things by projects. And so I usually have like a project hierarchy. Actually. And so for example, one project might be different. And so under dendron, what I actually do is I have a daily journal that I go over everything I need to do for that particular day. And let me think, what is the best way of showcasing, I'm just going to show you my to do actually.\n\n16:28  \nSo this is my to do for a dendron.\n\n16:32  \nAnd let me show you and the video. And what I do is intention, you have this notion of your journal notes. And so journal notes is basically whatever hierarchy you're currently in, and appends journal to it in the current date. And this is configurable. You can change the date format, you can change how it appends it, but I'm going to move on to tomorrow's date. And the way you do that is Ctrl Shift J. But you can use that to create a new Going on it. And then what I do is every day, are you familiar with snippets inside VS code?\n\n17:07  \nOh, I haven't used them inside VS code. I use external snippet code.\n\n17:14  \nWell, I, anyways, I use a bunch of snippets. And so apprehension journal snippet, and that will fill it out with\n\n17:21  \nOkay, might get the idea even though I haven't used it.\n\n17:25  \nYeah. And then the way I do two dues that's worked really well. For me, if I'm just working by myself, I have a snippet to make this bullet. And then I'll write you know, task one, task two tasks week.\n\n17:38  \nSomething that\n\n17:40  \ndension does fairly well is for example, sometimes like past one, it turns out to be a much bigger task and has a notion of sketch notes. And so let me and so this is all just special cases, it's you can create a sketch note by Command Shift s, and you can choose to add a title or not. If you don't add a title by default. It creates under your current high hierarchy denture and dots batch, and then the current date and timestamp. And you can think of this cache notice as caches, it's just, oh, I'm in a meeting, I need to take a note, I don't want to figure out where I'm gonna move it. So I'm just going to start you know, taking. And so that's kind of the purpose of discussion. And then later on, you can like rename it, and then follow it away somewhere if you want to. The more interesting thing is, if I highlight tasks, for example, and then I do the shortcut for a sketch note, what it does, is it creates a link from this task to the sketch note. And so now, you know, I can use this to create nested tasks. So you know, task 1.1 1.2 and if I find that, you know, task 1.1 is still too big, and I need to break it down even further. I can create another cash flow from that and then you know, create even more tasks. So you can go as deep as you want to that I usually find that to be To TCP level sign up yeah\n\n19:04  \nthat deeper probably needs to be broken up\n\n19:08  \nand but what's really cool about this is you can start off with a bullet and you can still keep this nicely bulleted list but then you can you know, expand upon it as much as you need to. Um, but as far as like project management goes the way I manage projects is I have my daily to dues and then I look at my to dues from the previous day. And then like anything I haven't done the previous day, I will copy it over into today. And then I will I use a bullet journal format so like I will add like a lesson sign.\n\n19:47  \nGo No, I don't use it, but I'm familiar with it.\n\n19:51  \nAnd something else that you can do is this is VS code feature more than attention feature better And then most people don't know about this. If you notice, for example, I have tags to some of my tasks, what I can do VS code has a search editor feature where you can search within your current note. And so if I type in start, it shows me For example, all my lines were have to start counting. And what's cool about this is this search is globbing. And so what I can do is by I have this shortcut set up, that brings me a search of whatever the current notice, but I can, for example, go here to show me Okay, what are all my past titled start within this month? And this shows me all of that materialized in a single view. All right, go What is everything, you know, in this year, or, you know, it's a quote skyjack so you can get as fancy as you like, and what what I will say this like this search, edit I view it's a VS code thing, not an engine thing, but it's Because the engine, if you follow dingemans method of putting stuff in hierarchies, it makes us search things super powerful, because now you can glob and search within. Yeah, the big dates. You can, for example, if you think back to a programming example, in Python, you can search, you know, under Python, everything in Python that has a gotcha tag, or everything in programming languages, that was hard. And that is something that you get for free with the hierarchy. This is nicely structured, being able to just search everything within that.\n\n21:38  \nSo what's really fascinating about this for me to watch, is that the name that you get, which is the hierarchy with with dots as separators on the mainframe, that's actually how hierarchical folder structures are achieved. Yeah,\n\n22:01  \nthat exact naming convention.\n\n22:04  \nNice. I haven't had the pleasure of using many mainframes in the days.\n\n22:09  \nYeah, so that was that one harks back, like decades for me. Okay.\n\n22:14  \nUm, so I have an unrelated question, what is the tool you're using? That's echoing the keystrokes. And that's actually VS code. So VS code has something called screencast mode. I'll go ahead, it will show you all the keystrokes.\n\n22:29  \nCool. All right.\n\n22:31  \nAnd that's a nice thing about building engine inside VS code is that, for me, like what was different about attention and what the thing I'm trying to promote is this idea of keeping your notes in a hierarchy and giving you the tools to work with that hierarchy. But then all the other stuff, for example, like being able to work with markdown and supporting multiple panes and having all the other stuff that you need in an editor. It's not really differentiating and you codecademy is a great place for that. And plus you have all the extensions. And VS code has and VS code has like a lot of new features. One of them another one that I really like that I find most people don't know about is you can toggle lines. So if you do option, arrow key, you can move lines up and down. And I find that really nice for prioritizing because I usually like to, you know, keep stuff in this sort of format. And this way, I can easily move stuff down when I'm done. And what's cool is it's not just a single line, you can highlight a whole block and you can move that whole block at a time. But it's just another one little known feature that I find it makes a big quality of life. Yeah.\n\n23:48  \nLet's see.\n\n23:51  \nUm, this. That's the other thing that you can do. indention is you can paste images. I find that's a question I get a lot specially with Mark And so I use a program called sketch, which lets me take a screenshot of the screen. And then if I do Command Shift C, it puts that image into my clipboard. And then inside address, you can kinda paste image command, which will take whatever is in your clipboard, put it in this path in the vault. And then now you have the picture. And I find that useful because I in markdown paste ads at night, adding media is usually like a problem that people have.\n\n24:32  \nYeah, obsidian handles that pretty well, much the same way. So yeah, that one I haven't had a lot of friction on.\n\n24:41  \nAnd\n\n24:42  \nthat's really interesting.\n\n24:45  \nYeah, the hierarchy is definitely the thing that I am working upon. And oh, one thing I haven't shown you and this is more of an advanced feature, but you can create schemas for your hierarchies and you can think of femurs is kind of being able to type check. And so I'll show you what I mean by that. So right now I'm creating a lens. And the way I go to schema is I do Command Shift L. And this shows me all the schemas that I have. So it's kind of lookup, but instead of looking for markdown files, I'll explore YAML files. And so your schema, it is just a yamo. And it follows. And what it does, so is it says that, okay, there is a node that is named. And so Lang is the root of your hierarchy. And you can, for example, say that this has children. So for example, Python, it's Ruby. And the only thing you need to specify for the children is that they exist. And now you need to reload the index between schema changes because it hasn't picked up on Live, that's going to change later. But now, if I go into my lookup, if I type in Lang, for example, you'll notice it's actually a little book to it. And the little book over here means that hey, Lang is part of the schema. And if I go down, I can see that Oh, like there's a little book next to Python. That's part of the schema. If you look at JavaScript, because I created\n\n26:31  \nit. It's not in the schema, if you look at Java, this little question mark, because it's not in the schema. And the reason you might want to do this is for example, like as I'm building my hierarchy, oh, one thing is you don't have to like enumerate everything. So this a namespace property where you can say this is a namespace. And so now, this is essentially saying that this is going to match now Not start the globbing pattern. The scheme is just based off this simple globbing pattern\n\n27:06  \nthat would pick up if it existed.\n\n27:08  \nYeah. And so now if I go to Java, this little book to it, because that's in a sec, okay, I recognize it. Now, the interesting part here is now for my children, for example, if I say data,\n\n27:21  \nso data structures,\n\n27:24  \nand you know, and data, let's say that as their children, like, spring, I have a lot of different autocompletes. So that Well, sometimes,\n\n27:38  \nyeah, no, I know how that works. I get that a lot. Yeah.\n\n27:43  \nSo let's say that I crave\n\n27:46  \nthat. And so this schema of the way that the globbing patterns work is the children will inherit the parents as a prefix. So this will match Lang dot star dot data. And then string will match Lang dot star dot data watchman. But the schema is also hierarchal. And so now, if I reload my index, if I go to lang.db, dot away, for example, there's a book, because it's part of my schema. But if I look into your data, that Boolean does nothing, because it's not part of my schema. And schemas are really lightweight. It's just that yamo and we don't stop you from creating things outside of your schema, we just show you a question mark. But it's nice. For example, if you're building a programming language hierarchy, and just like sometimes use Google, sometimes use Boolean and you want to keep it consistent, you can document it in your schema. And the engine will also tell you when you're going outside of it, and in the future, we'll add options if you want you to actually enforce it. So you can say like, hey, like, actually don't have any great things that go outside of this. Okay? And that's just because like if my this is how likely entropy builds up and up looks like you name one thing for one fee and then another one for another, and then you have a million different things.\n\n29:07  \nYep, I have, I have several backlinks that I have to go clean up because I did somebody's name or title or something differently in two different places.\n\n29:20  \nl and schema strike now. We are also this going to be more features that you can do with schemas. And right now, it does two things. One is it gives you the little book with a little question mark, if you're in a note that matches it. The other thing is you can assign templates to it. So for example, for this thing, I can say that it has a template. And what that means is when I create a note that matches the schema, automatically apply this template to it. And so the idea of this template is going to be the name of another note. And so for example, if I just do a Lang, template, M and M Then I can say this is something inflige. And it's a note template. And the reason you have this this in the future will have different types of templates, you can make templates from snippets, or other sources. And now if I reload my index, and let's create a screen for something I don't have fishing for so let's say Lang dot java data archwing. And oh, something else that schemas that you do is it autocompletes so like, even though again, string haven't been created, it shows you Hey, this matches the dang schema. According to that schema, you happen assumptions.\n\n30:40  \nNice. So if I type in train,\n\n30:46  \nit shows you how demos will always break your hearts.\n\n30:52  \nOf course,\n\n30:54  \nthat's me.\n\n30:57  \ndelete this. So Command Shift D is to do Return note.\n\n31:03  \nAnd\n\n31:06  \nlet's try this again. I might have to reload the window for it to pick it up. So, let me I just reloaded the window. I'm going to delete this and then try to create it one more time. And then hopefully, but\n\n31:26  \nOkay, I'll look into that. But so yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n31:37  \nAnd there are other things, but these are essentially like the core parts of dendron. Something else that you can do is you can take your notes, and you can publish it to GitHub. So that's a build command. Right now, because we're in an empty space, you need to run another command to add in some pals, but basically what that when you do build power On a workspace is that it can, it'll generate, it'll turn it into static files that you can publish to GitHub. And it'll have the same template as an engine website. Um, and it's also hierarchical. So you know you the same hierarchy you happen engine you can have on your website, you can choose to publish either everything in your vault, or you can choose which hierarchies you want to publish. And then the other thing is this search bar here. This is actually also path based. So the same lookup mechanism that you use insight engine, you can also use on an engine website.\n\n32:42  \nNice. Yeah.\n\n32:43  \nCool.\n\n32:44  \nYep. Well, thank you. Yeah, no problem.\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html","relUrl":"notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html"},{"doc":"Terms","title":"Terms","hpath":"dendron.ref.terms","content":"\n### Command Palette\n\nThe [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) lets you access all command based functionality inside vscode.

Dendron uses telemetry primarily for collecting usage data.\n\nThis page describes the overall telemetry approach for Dendron, what kind of data is collected and how to opt-out of data collection.\n\n## Why does Dendron collect metrics?\n\nTelemetry helps us better understand _how many users_ are using our products and _how often_ they are using our products. Unlike many telemetry services, our telemetry implementation is intentionally **limited in scope**.\n\nWe use telemetry to answer the following questions: \n  - how many people are actively using Dendron?\n  - how performant is Dendron over time and how do new changes impact performance?\n  - what features are most useful for users?\n\n## What is not collected\n\nDendron will **never** collect data inside your notes. We believe that your personal knowledge is for your eyes alone. \n\n## What is collected\n\nThe below is a collection of common fields that are collected\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `app` |  _string_  | Currently installed version of the product (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)                          |\n|      `ideVersion` |  _string_  | Currently installed version of the IDE (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)                          |\n|      `userAgent` |  _string_  |  The specific IDE in question(e.g. `VSCodium`)                          |\n|         `arch` |  _string_  | Client's operating system architecture (e.g. `amd64`).                                 |\n|           `os` |  _string_  | Client's operating system (e.g. `darwin`).                                             |\n| `nodeVersion` |  _string_  | Client's node version (e.g. `v12.12.0`).                                               |\n|    `anonymousId` |  _string_  | Random, non-identifiable signature nanoID (e.g. `JC6NXxDa0lDFD1Mu7U2Ga`) |\n|    `timestamp` |  _string_  | When the request was made   |\n\n\n\n## When is data collected?\n\nData is collected in scenarios that are described below. \n\n### Startup \n\nWhen Dendron initializes, we collect data about on initialization time. This helps us measure the performance impact of changes that run before startup as well as improvements to our indexing performance over time. \n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `duration` |  _number_| Number of seconds for startup\n|      `numNotes` |  _number_| Number of notes across all vaults (rounded to the nearest 10 notes) |\n|      `numVaults` |  _number_| Number of vaults in workspace |\n|      `noCaching` |  _boolean_| Check whether caching is disabled |\n\n\n### Installation/Upgrade \nWhen Dendron is first installed or upgraded, we collect information about both previous and current versions. This helps us plan deprecation policies. \n\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `previousVersion` |  _string_| Previous version of Dendron |\n|      `duration` |  _number_| Number of seconds for startup\n\n### Lookup\n\nWhen lookup is performed, Dendron collects profiling information for different phases of lookup. This helps us measure the performance impact of optimizations and features we add to lookup.\n\nEvents\n- Lookup Show: when lookup is presented\n- Lookup Update: when lookup items are updated\n- Lookup Accept: when a result from lookup is accepted\n\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `flavor` |  _string_| What kind of lookup (\"schema\" or \"note\") |\n|      `error` |  _boolean_| Did an error happen during this phase? |\n|      `source` |  _string_| What initiated the lookup? (\"onValueChange\", \"updatePickerBehavior:journal\", etc ) |\n|      `createNewNote` |  _boolean_| Was a new note created during this phase? |\n\n### Other\n\nThese are groupings of other metrics we collect. We collect them to gather performance impact and improvements across various features.\n\nEvents\n- TreeView Ready: measures when the web ui based [[TreeView|dendron.ref.web-ui#treeview]] is finished loading\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `duration` |  _number_| How long it takes for the tree view to be initialized |\n\n### Telemetry Toggle\nWhen telemetry is disabled or enabled, we collect information about the event to let us get an estimate of the number of untracked clients\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `reason` |  _enum_| Why telemetry was disabled. See values [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-server/src/analytics.ts#L73:L73) |\n\n## How to opt out of data collection\n\nIf you've disabled telemetry from the [Visual Studio Code Telemetry setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry), no further action is needed. You can set this option in your workspace settings, or user settings.\n\nTo disable telemetry in Dendron specifically, run the [[Disable Telemetry|dendron.topic.commands#disable-telemetry]] command.\n\n## Why not have opt-in telemetry?\n\nThe goal of telemetry is to make data driven decisions about features and use cases that can make the most difference to our users. \n\nOne way we could collect data is to conduct surveys but traditionally, these had very low participation and are also biased towards users that are already active in our community. Having telemetry allows us to collect feedback from our larger user base and avoids this bias. \n\nOpt-in telemetry, at best, gives us a narrow and biased set of users. At this point, we are back to make decisions based on limited data. Opt-out telemetry that is limited in scope is the tradeoff we made in terms of preserving user privacy while still gathering meaningful data that can help improve the product. \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/84df871b-9442-42fd-b4c3-0024e35b5f3c.html","relUrl":"notes/84df871b-9442-42fd-b4c3-0024e35b5f3c.html"},{"doc":"Status","title":"Status","hpath":"dendron.ref.status","content":"\n\nSometimes, you'll see a `status` underneath certain features or options.

It is meant to be the fastest way for people to create, find, and collaborate on the information they care about.\n\nAll note taking tools make it easy for you to get information in. They all struggle to help you find that information once you've accumulated a good number of notes. Dendron is optimized to help you find your notes no matter how many notes you have (Kevin, the founder, uses Dendron to manage +20K notes, all of which he can access in seconds)\n\nDendron is open source and local-first, meaning that anyone can build their own version of Dendron and that your data always stays with you.

You can get version numbers by running the following commands\n\n```sh\nnpm info @dendronhq/dendron-cli\nnpm info @dendronhq/dendron-11ty\n```\n\n## Common Errors\n\n### Engine not Initialized\n- cause: \n  - 1. You are not running inside a workspace\n  - 2. Localhost is blocked\n- diagnose\n  - 1. See fix\n  - 2. Look for `ECONNREFUSED` in the [[logs|dendron.topic.commands#dendrondev-open-logs]]\n- fix: \n  - 1.

If you are encountering this, you'll want to copy the following into `dendron.yml`\n\n```yml\njournal:\n    dailyDomain: daily\n    name: journal\n    dateFormat: y.MM.dd\n    addBehavior: childOfDomainNamespace\n    firstDayOfWeek: 1\n```\n\n## Common Fixes\n\n### Uninstall Conflicting Extensions\nMarkdown Notes, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Markdown All in One are known to interfere with Dendron\n\n### Use Dendron Markdown Preview\n\nThe VSCode default markdown preview has the same icon as Dendron's Markdown Preview.  It is currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).\n\nMeanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command\n\n![Markdown preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-md.png)\n\n### Reload Dendron\n\nSometimes Dendron views can get out of sync with notes. To fix, run `Dendron: Reload Index` to manually sync. If that doesn't work, you can also try `Developer: Reload Window` to restart VSCode.\n\n### Remove notes that extend from root\n\nWe currently don't support creating children of `root.md` This note is special. While the contents can be edited, creating a hierarchy off root is not officially supported\n\n### Run Dendron inside a Workspace\n\nDendron requires a VSCode [workspace file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files) to operate. Make sure to open the **dendron.code-workspace** file by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files)\n\n### Clear the cache\n\nDelete dendron [[cache|dendron.ref.caching#summary]] files.\n\n### Whitelisting localhost\n\nDendron starts a [[local server|dendron.dev.design#overview]] in the background and the plugin connects to it to index notes. Check that you don't have anything that is running or blocking localhost.\n\n### Correctly Format the Note\n\nDendron can sometimes fail to load due to a malformed note. Common issues:\n- [[Frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] is missing\n- frontmatter has no id\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### Error upgrading\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)\n\nDendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.\n\nThe most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.\n\n## Schemas\n\n### I'm getting a `you cannot define a mapping item when in a sequence` when trying to define a schema\n\nThat means there's an issue with your yaml. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax. \n\n### Schema Templates aren't working\n\nSchema templates are defined as YAML objects. The most common mistake is putting them down as a list\n\nFor example, this is a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    id: journal.template.daily\n    type: note\n```\n\nThis is not a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    - id: journal.template.daily\n      type: note\n```\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Why can't I click the checkbox?\n\nIt could be that you are using the VSCode default markdown instead of Dendron's Markdown Preview. \n\n![[dendron.guides.troubleshooting#using-the-wrong-preview,1:#*]]\n\n### Still initializing.  Please close this window and try again after Dendron has been initialized.\n\nWhen Dendron starts up, it initializes a local server which is responsible for indexing notes and fetching note metadata. Plugins like the preview depend on the server being initialized before activating. You'll know the server is initialized after you see a `Dendron is activated` notification.\n\n### Get the logs\n\nOpen the [[output view|dendron.topic.workbench#output-view]] and use the dropdown menu to find the log titled `DENDRON`. \n\n\n## Linux\n\n### Reference to Another Note on Ubuntu\n\nIf Ctrl+Shift+R (reference to another note) doesn't work on Ubuntu, do `sudo apt install xsel`.\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Can't open local preview\n\nDendron runs the preview on port 8080. Make sure you don't have something already running there.\n\n- windows\n```powershell\n# get ids of processes\nGet-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080).OwningProcess\n\n# if you see any result, you can stop them using the following command\nStop-process -Id {IDS_FROM_ABOVE}\n```\n\n- linux\n```bash\n# get ids\nlsof -l -n -P -i tcp:8080 \n\n# kill\nkill -9 {IDS}\n```\n\n## Etc\n\n### Error: spawn git ENOENT\n\nCheck if you have git installed. You can find more details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42545885/vs-code-error-spawn-git-enoent)\n\n### Clicking on the link creates multiple files\n\nThis is likely due to other extensions that you have installed that provide conflicting definitions for [[wiki links|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]].\n\nThe most likely culprits are `foam` or `markdown-notes`. Uninstalling them will fix this issue. \n\nYou can see your installed \n\n### Dendron fails to initialize\n\n- check if you have a file with two consecutive dots: `eg. pro..foo.bar`\n\n### Multiple Vaults with the same name\n\nYou will get this if you have multiple [[vaults|dendron.topic.config.dendron#vaults]] that have the same name. This is an error with Dendron since Dendron requires all vault names be unique. You can fix this by removing the duplicate vaults or setting a unique [[name|dendron.topic.config.dendron#name]] property for the vault.  \n\n\n## Send a support request\n\nIf none of the troubleshooting methods work, you can ping kevin on Discord or submit a github issue.\n\nWhen doing either of these things, please include the following information:\n\n- [[Plugin Logs|dendron.guides.cook#checking-logs]]\n- [[Server Logs|dendron.guides.cook#server-logs]]\n- Contents of your [[workspace settings|dendron.guides.settings]]\n- Contents of [[dendron.yml|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html","relUrl":"notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html"},{"doc":"Tips","title":"Tips","hpath":"dendron.guides.tips","content":"\n## Bucket\n\n### Peeking\n\nIt is possible to [peek](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek) at wiki-links in Dendron.

This is really helpful for prioritizing todos among other things ✅\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips-move-lines.gif)\n\n### Search Editor\n\n- [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_43#_search-editors)\n\nAlso known as the coolest feature in vscode that most people have never heard of. This lets you view and save your search results in a full blown text editor. You can combine it with Dendron's hierarchies to do some amazing things, like aggregating all your todos and scoping your search to a specific hierarchy. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.search-editor.gif)\n\nYou can open search editor via keyboard shortcut. I use it to start a search with the current filename. works really well with Dendron hierarchies.\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+s f\",\n    \"command\": \"search.action.openNewEditor\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"query\": \"\",\n      \"triggerSearch\": false,\n      \"focusResults\": false,\n      \"includes\": \"${fileBasenameNoExtension}\",\n    }the following line\n  }\n```\n\n### Stylized Tags Using Custom CSS\n\nTo customize the look and feel of your tags, you can do so by using the following convention and [CSS edits](https://www.dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html#can-i-customize-the-markdown-preview-css).\n\nLet's say you have a `books` hierarchy and you have a `books.high-growth-handbook` note. You have all the tags you use for books under a `books.tags.` namespace.\n\nIf you use links for tags: `[[#business|books.tags.business]]`, you can use this CSS to customize their look:\n\n```css\n/* General tag styling */\na[href*=\"tag.\"] {\n    color: #000;\n    background: #fff;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0 10px;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n}\n/* Customizing the look of specific tags */\na[href*=\".tags.business\"] {\n    color: #fff;\n    background: rgb(36, 89, 233);\n}\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tags.png)\n\n### Collapsing Headers and Bullets\n\nYou can collapse headers at different levels and bullets at different indentation levels inside VSCode. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.toggle-bullets.gif)\n\n\n### Create a new note in a deeply nested hierarchy \n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/758235198403117087)\n\n- Problem: \n   - You are currently in `foo` and you want to create the note `foo.child1.child2.my-note`. You don't want to type out the full path. Is there an easier way to create `my-note` than typing out the full path?\n- Solution: \n  - VSCode doesn't support autocomplete inside the quick input widget which Dendron uses for lookups. We are experimenting with different ways of getting around this. \n  - Today, the workaround is to create a wiki-link inside another note and navigate via link to create it. \n  - Another method, if you know you will be creating multiple children under a single deeply nested parent, is to pin the parent and create the child from the parent \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n### Automate Git Tasks\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/742532267058004098/759130627781558403)\n- Problem:\n  - You want an easier way to `git add && git commit && git push`\n- Solution\n  - Use [git automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit).\n\n### Publish to GitHub Pages with Actions\n\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/749641193322971238/759190468671438848)\n\nIt's possible to publish your Dendron site to GitHub Pages without the shadow copy of your notes in the `docs` directory.\n\nYou can create a GitHub Actions workflow to perform the export process using the Dendron CLI and push the result to your `pages` branch, triggering a Pages build.\n\nNote that this configuration won't retain any history on the `paths` branch. Paths below are relative to your workspace root.\n\nIgnore the shadow directories in `.gitignore`:\n\n```\ngitignore\n# Dendron\n/docs/assets/\n/docs/notes/\n/docs/_site/\n\n# npm\n/node_modules/\n```\n\nCreate a `package.json` to install the package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dendron-cli\": \"dendron-cli\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/LukeCarrier/brain.git\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"UNLICENSED\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@dendronhq/dendron-cli\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate the workflow `.github/workflows/dendron.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Dendron\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout source\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Install npm dependencies\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Build pod\n      run: npm run dendron-cli -- buildSite --wsRoot . \n\n    - name: Deploy site\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_branch: pages\n        publish_dir: docs/\n        force_orphan: true\n        enable_jekyll: true\n```\n\nConfigure your repository's Pages settings as follows:\n\n* _Branch_: `pages`\n* _Folder_: _/ (root)_\n\nFinally, commit these three files and push them to your `master` branch. Within a few seconds you should see the workflow run, your `pages` branch get updated and your Pages build start.\n\n### Go back to previous Note\n\nUse \"> Quick Open Previous Recently Used...` to navigate through recently opened notes\n  - default shortcut: `CTRL-TAB`\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.most-recent.gif)\n\n\n### Keep Track of Tabs\n\nIt's really easy to lose sight of your tabs, especially with menu items occluding the little horizontal space you have for tabs. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.nav.jpg)\n\nInstead of relying on the menu, you can use `Show All Editors` to see all tabs via a dropdown. You can also narrow down tabs after selection.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.editors.gif)\n\nYou can streamline this process by assigning a keyboard shortcut to the command. Below is an example.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+t\",\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.showAllEditors\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n\n### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron\n\nFirst copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)\n\n<!-- \n\n### Custom Outlines\n\nTODO: need to add more details\n\nOutlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)\n\nIn those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\"> \n<p>Tips - Breadcrumbs - Watch Video</p> \n<img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\n\nYou can use the same technique \n\n# Generating all journal notes ahead of time\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701265/how-to-generate-a-list-of-all-dates-in-a-range-using-the-tools-available-in-bash\n-->\n\n## Workbench\n\n### Navigating a hierarchy\n\nOne easy way of navigating hierarchies it to click on the file name. This will reveal a dropdown that shows you all siblings of the current note. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/guide.siblings.jpg)\n\n### Remove Markdown Buttons in Menu Bar\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/758408534848831558)\n\n```json\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bold\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.italic\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.strikethrough\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bullets\": false,\n```\n\n### Moving Panes\n\nYou can move vscode tabs using the following builtin commands:\n- `View: Move Editor Into Next Group`\n- `View: Move Editor Into Previous Group`\n\nThey are mapped on to the following keyboard shortcuts:\n- mac: `cmd+ctrl+left|right`\n\nThis is helpful for looking at your notes side by side. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Pinning Tabs\n\nYou can pin tabs in VSCode by right clicking on a tab and selecting `Pin Tab`. \n\nThe latest VSCode lets you control pin behavior for tabs. It's not currently documented as of 2020.09.28 but as of the latest insider build, it has a few different options to control the pinned behavior. \n\n- options:\n  - normal (default), normal tab size with a pin icon\n  - shrink: reduced tab size with some text visible\n  - compact: only icon visible\n\n```json\n\"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing\": \"shrink\"\n```\n\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nVSCode can be visually noisy. You can hide most of the UI by toggling `Zen Mode` with a three panel layout. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.zen.jpg)\n\nThe following setting overrides are useful: \n\n```json\n// by default, zen mode will open a new \"workspace\" which I don't like\n\"zenMode.fullScreen\": false,\n// I'm a vim user so I like my line numbers\n\"zenMode.hideLineNumbers\": false,\n```\n\nTo navigate tabs and look at the breadcrumb outline, You can use the following commands\n\n```json\nworkbench.action.showAllEditors -> (no shortcut by default, consider mapping to ctrl + t)\nbreadcrumbs.focusAndSelect -> cmd + t\n```\n\nYou can see a video of this workflow in the video below.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n## Snippets\n\n### Have links auto-complete without additional key presses\n\n- Update your settings to the following\n```json\n// The following settings will only apply to markdown files:\n  \"[markdown]\": {\n    // quickSuggestions true will provide suggestions as you type.\n    // If you turn this on and DO NOT want suggestions\n    // for non-wiki-link, non-tag words,\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": true,\n    // This is poorly documented, but seems to offer suggestions\n    // from any word in open document when turned on, which\n    // can be a little distracting in markdown docs:\n    \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false,\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n    // Set this to false if you turn on quickSuggestions\n    // but don't want suggestions for markdown related snippets\n    // as you type:\n    \"editor.suggest.showSnippets\": false,\n  },\n```\n\n## Markdown\n\n### Always have the preview open\n\n\nYou can add the following setting to your workspace to always have a markdown editor show up with your content. \n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Symbol search\n\nWhen using the standard file-search in vscode (`ctrl-P`), you can search for all titles in your workspace if you use the starting keyword `#`\n\nExample: if i know i had a header with the title \"cheatsheet\", i can type in `# cheatsheet`\n\n### Auto bullet list\n\nVSCode doesn't support auto-formatting by default. You can use the following workaround to mimic the behavior.\n\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `-`\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n- \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `*`\n\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n* \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n> Credit for this recipe goes to @Stigs#0135 \n\n### Academic Notes with Templates  \n\nWith Dendron's [[schema templates|dendron.topic.schema#template]] you can make templates that are applied automatically whenever you create reading notes. You can even make different templates for different types of sources. For instance, you can have one template for articles and another for books.\n\n- Add an `article.schema.yml` schema file that applies an `article.template.notes.md` template file\n- Add a `book.schema.yml` schema file that applies a `book.template.notes.md` template file\n- Add other schema and template files with relevant patterns for conference presentations, TED talks, edited collections, etc.\n\nYou can adopt or adapt these schema template files for [books and articles](https://github.com/ryan-p-randall/some-dendron-starter-files).\n\nOnce you've made similar schema and template files, when you make a new file using the [[lookup bar|dendron.topic.lookup.create]], the template will be applied to your new note in the corresponding schema's domain. A new note with a name like `article.hall-stuart-encoding-decoding.notes` will apply the article template, and a new note with a name like `book.hooks-bell-feminism-is-for-everybody.notes` will apply the book template.\n\n## Other Tools\n\nThis is a list of other tools that work well with Dendron.\n- [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): local markdown editor that works well with Dendron notes (mac only)\n\n## Other VSCode Extensions\n\n### Git\n- [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit): one command to commit and push all changes\n- [Git Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc): auto-commit and (optionally) auto push your notes at fixed intervals\n- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n- [Path AutoComplete](https://github.com/ionutvmi/path-autocomplete): Path autocomplete for VSCode\n\n### Coding\n- [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)\n\n### Other\n- [Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros): Define custom macros \n- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim): VIM key bindings 😍\n- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks): Bookmark lines within File [Vertical Limit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=generik.vertical-limit): Work with multiple cursors and blocks of text\n- [CodeUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanraposo.codeui): Easier customization of every part of the VSCode UI\n- [Open in Typora](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cyberbiont.vscode-open-in-typora&utm_source=VSCode.pro&utm_campaign=AhmadAwais): Open note in Typora\n\n## Other Browser Extensions\n\n### Web Clipper\n- [Markdown Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB): markdown based web clipper\n- [Roam Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcoimieglmhdjdoplhpcmifgplkbfibp)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html","relUrl":"notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html"},{"doc":"Settings","title":"Settings","hpath":"dendron.guides.settings","content":"You can update Dendron settings by using the VSCode workspace settings by using the command prompt to `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you are comfortable with editing raw JSON, you can use `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` to work with the settings in raw JSON\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html","relUrl":"notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html"},{"doc":"Migration","title":"Migration","hpath":"dendron.guides.migration","content":"This note covers migrating your notes from other tools\n\n## Obsidian\n\n1.

You can download the [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) extension to achieve the functionality in the interim.\n\n### Launch the command palette\n\nThis lets you execute commands inside vscode\n\n-   Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n-   macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n-   Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n### Analyze notes using elasticsearch\n\n-   WARNING: this is advanced material\n\nWith Dendron, you can export your notes using the [[JSON Export Pod|dendron.topic.pod]] and then use that data to analyze your notes using elasticsearch.\n\nThis video walkthrough walks you through that process.\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nYou can download the repo used in this walkthrough from [github](https://github.com/dendronhq/sample-elasticsearch-demo)\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n-   download and run elasticsearch\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Export your data using the JSON Export Pod\n2. Create an index in elasticsearch (we're using version 7.9)\n\n```json\nPUT notes\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"created\": {\n        \"type\":   \"date\",\n        \"format\": \"epoch_millis\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Pipe exported JSON into the newly created index.\n\n```bash\ncat /path/to/exported/notes.json | jq -c '.[] | {\"index\": {\"_index\": \"notes\", \"notes\", \"_id\": .id}}, .' | curl -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @-\n```\n\n4. Profit!\n\nSome potential use cases you can do using elasticsearch and Dendron:\n\n-   filter your notes by any logical combination of custom attributes\n-   make a heatmap of notes created by date\n-   get a full list of tags used across your vault and on a per hierarchy basis\n-   anything else you can thin of :)\n\nSome useful additional links:\n\n-   [elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html)\n-   [elasticsearch vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic)\n\n### Convert timestamps in the frontmatter\n\nCurrently, Dendron notes show timestamps in epoch time which is not the most parsable for humans. You can use the [timestamp converter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stalinbalraj.timestamp-converter) order to see a human representation of said timestamp.\n\n### Use Dendron with Anki\n\n-   [Anki for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasew.anki)\n\n### Use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code\n\nYou can use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code by launching it with the [command line flags](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_advanced-cli-options) `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir`:\n\n```\ncode --user-data-dir=/path/to/code-dendron --extensions-dir=/path/to/code-dendron-ext\n```\n\n### Mobile Support\n\nDendron does not have a dedicated mobile client at this time. There are numerous mobile markdown editors that can be used to view and edit Dendron notes. Some popular options are listed below:\n\n-   [Git Journal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal)\n-   [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)\n-   [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes&hl=en_US&gl=US)\n-   [Neutrinote](https://neutrinote.wordpress.com/) (Android only)\n-   [Noteless](https://github.com/redsolver/noteless) (Android only). This _just_ received experimental Dendron support so worth trying out.\n\nMost mobile apps do not have git support.\n\n-   If you are on iOS, you can follow the instructions [here](https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/) to sync your git backed Dendron with any note taking tool on iOS.\n-   If you are on Android, you can read [this writeup](https://mstempl.netlify.app/post/working-with-git-on-android/) by one of users on having Git Sync on Android devices\n\n### WebClipper\n\nYou can use the [markdownload-markdown-web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi) extension to clip content as markdown from Chrome.\n\n### Regex\n\nTo get familiar with regex syntax, try [regexr](https://regexr.com/) is a great place to experiment with different queries.\n\n### Automatically Convert Casing on a Note\n\nYou can use the [string converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adamwalzer.string-converter) extension to change `[[normal note with spaces]]` to `[[normal-note-with-spaces]]` as well as a series of other text transformations.\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Prevent newly opened files from replacing the preview pane?\n\nSet the following option in your workspace settings\n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Customize Theme\n\nTo change the color theme, you can update the `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` vscode setting\n\n### Customize CSS\n\nYou can see instructions for customizing css [here](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css)\n\n## VSCode\n\n### Use Dendron with a current folder\n\n-   1. start by initializing a workspace\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#initialize-workspace:#*]]\n\n-   2. by default, dendron uses a `vaults` folder underneath your workspace to store you vaults. Update your [[settings|dendron.guides.settings]] and change `vault` to the path of your current notes (alternatively, you can also copy your current notes into `vault`)\n\n```\n\"folders\": [\n    {\n        \"path\": \"vault\"\n    },\n    ...\n],\n```\n\n-   3. Run `> Dendron: Reload Index` for Dendron to pick up changes\n\n### Access Dendron Workspace from multiple windows\n\nThere are usually two scenarios:\n\n1. you want two windows of different workspaces\n2. you want two windows of the same workspace\n\n-   for 1, create a new window and initialize a new workspace in some directory that is different from your first workspace\n-   for 2, you have a few options\n    -   a. initialize a new workspace in a different directory. open the settings using `> Open User Workspace settings (JSON)`. change the folder to the path of your vault in the initial workspace. run `> Reload Window` for the changes to take affect\n    -   b. use a different version of vscode to open the same workspace (eg. vscode insider, vscodium, vscode regular). you need to do this because vscode will re-use the same window when opening the same workspace\n\n### Change the sorting order in the Outline Panel\n\nClick the three little dots next to outline to change the sorting order. You can sort by **Name** (alphabetical) or **Position** (linear order)\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.vscode.outline.jpg)\n\n### Change the sorting oder in the Explorer Panel\n\nSee instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51543871/sorting-files-in-vs-code-explorer)\n\n### Drag and Drop files into Dendron\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.drag.jpg)\n\nTo drag files into Dendron, open the workspace pane on the side to drag and drop. We currently recommend you only do this for non-markdown files that you want to link to inside your vaults.\n\n### Find Installed Extensions\n\n1. Navigate to the extensions pane\n2. Search for `@installed`\n\n### Add Dendron to application launchers on Linux desktops\n\nLinux desktop systems often include application launchers where you can see the applications installed on your computer and launch them. You can add an entry for Dendron to the application launcher by creating a file at `~/.local/share/applications/dendron.desktop`, then pasting the following contents into it.\n\n```\n[Desktop Entry]\nComment=A personal knowledge management tool that grows as you do.\nExec=code --no-sandbox --new-window ~/Dendron/dendron.code-workspace\nName=Dendron\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=code\nKeywords=dendron;notes;pkm;\nCategories=Utility;TextEditor;\n```\n\nMake sure the path to the dendron workspace matches your setup. Then, run `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/` in a terminal or restart your system. You should now see Dendron in the launcher under the Utilities section, or if you search for Dendron in your launcher. Launching Dendron from here will launch VSCode with your Dendron workspace open.\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Enable Table of Contents\n\nWhen viewing your notes locally, you can view the toc either from the outline view or by toggling the preview\n\n-   from the outline\n    ![[dendron.topic.workbench#outline-view,1:#*]]\n\n-   from the preview\n    ![[dendron.topic.preview#table-of-contents,1]]\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Incremental Builds\n\nYou can do incremental builds from Jekyll and Dendron\n\n-   when previewing the site locally, add the `incremental` flag\n    ```bash\n    bundle exec jekyll s --watch --incremental\n    ```\n-   when building the site, also add an incremental flag\n    -   NOTE: you'll need `rsync` installed to use the incremental flag\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault} --incremental\n```\n\n### Automatically Update Site while editing\n\nThe following instructions cover how to update your local preview everytime you make a change to your notes\n\n-   install `dendron-cli`\n    ![[dendron.topic.cli#installation,1:#*]]\n\n-   have jekyll watch your site-root\n\n```bash\ncd {your-site-root}\nbundle exec jekyll s --watch\n```\n\n-   use `nodemon` to watch your vault\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nodemon\nnodemon --watch {path/to/vault} --ext md dendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault}\n```\n\n-   NOTE: you can combine this with incremental builds to have the best editing experience\n\n### Publish password protected site using AWS Amplify\n\nYou can click [here](https://main.d19svbygngqnpb.amplifyapp.com/) to see a demo of the end result.\n\nYou can access the site with username: `dendron`, password: `hierarchy`.\n\n-   NOTE: this requires hosting your site on AWS. For most people, this will end up costing you a few cents a month.\n\n#### Setup your github repo\n\n1. Create a new github repo using this [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-amplify-template/generate).\n2. In your Dendron workspace, remove the `docs` directory and clone your newly created repository\n    ```bash\n    cd {your-workspace}\n    rm -r docs\n    git clone {your-repo} docs\n    ```\n\n#### Setup aws\n\n1. Create an [aws account](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n2. Login to your AWS account and go select the [Amplify Service](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-west-2#/)\n    - ![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/amplify.select.jpg)\n3. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to connect your github with your amplify\n4. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/access-control.html) to restrict access to your site.\n5. Verify that your site is now password protected\n\n#### Publish your notes\n\n1. Update `siteRepoDir` in `dendron.yml` with the location of your github directory\n    - Your `dendron.yml` should look similar to the one below\n        ```yml\n        site:\n            copyAssets: true\n            siteHierarchies:\n                - root\n            siteRootDir: docs\n            usePrettyRefs: true\n            siteRepoDir: docs\n        ```\n2. Run `> Dendron: Publish` to build your notes for publication and push your notes\n3. Your notes are now published privately behind a password\n\n## Workspace\n\n### Using Dendron with Github and Git\n\nOne of our users published a great beginners guide on this [here](https://mstempl.netlify.app/post/dendron-git/)\n\n### Adding a Remote Vault to your Dendron Workspace\n\nIf you haven't already done so, install Dendron and initialize a workspace by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.install]].\n\nUse the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#remote-vault]] command via the [[command palette|dendron.ref.terms#command-palette]], select remote vault, and paste the git url of the vault that you like to add\n\n### Converting a local vault to a remote vault\n\n1. If you're vault is committed along with your workspace, use `git rm --cached` to remove it from the workspace repo and use `git init` to initialze your vault as a standalone repo\n1. Create a remote repo and push your vault to that repo\n1. Run [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]] and add the git [[remote|dendron.topic.config.dendron#remote]] urls to the repo. the entries should look like what you see below\n\n### Using Dendron with Code\n\nThe easiest current way to do this is to have multiple instances of VSCode open and toggle between the two. If you are very adventurous, you might even have [multiple versions of vscode](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/7f197479-279e-4b1e-9edd-21bf2da423b0.html#dendron-setup) for different contexts.\n\nWe are working on being able to run Dendron without the need for a workspace. You can track the progress of this on this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/322)\n\n### Renaming a Vault\n\nWe currently haven't implemented a command to do but you can use the current manual steps to implement.\n\n1. Update the [[name|dendron.topic.config.dendron#name]] property in `dendron.yml`\n1. Update the name property on the corresponding [[workspace folders|dendron.topic.config.vscode-config#folders]]\n1. Replace any [[cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] with the name of the new workspace\n\n-   ctrl search `dendron://{vaultName}` and replace it with the new vaultName\n\n1. Run `> Reload Window` when these steps are completed\n\n### Private Vaults\n\nYou can create private vaults that won't be published or initialized when others clone the workspace. To do this, run [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] and add your private vault as a local vault. After it's been added, run [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]] and set the [[visibility|dendron.topic.config.dendron#visibility]] of the vault to \"private\" in `dendron.yml`.\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n      visibility: private\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html","relUrl":"notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html"},{"doc":"Best Practices","title":"Best Practices","hpath":"dendron.guides.best-practices","content":"\n## Naming\n\nWe recommend using all lower [[kebab case|dendron.concepts#kebab-case]] when naming your files. For example, `awesome apples` would be `awesome-apples`. This would be stored in your file system as `awesome-apples.md`. \n\nDendron will auto-generate a human friendly title based on the last part of your hierarchy. By default, Dendron uses [title.sh](https://title.sh/) to generate titles based on your note name. Titles generated are consistent with the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). Dendron will replace `-` with a ` ` when generating titles. \n\nIf you end up adding custom capitalization to your file name, Dendron will not attempt to generate a title but return the last part of your hierarchy as is.\n\nSome examples below:\n\n```\n- awesome-apples.md -> title: Awesome Apples\n- fruit.awesome-apples.md -> title: Awesome Apples\n- fruit.Custom-Capitalization -> title: Custom-Capitalization\n```\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8d3c8142-7481-40da-9a5c-69a3d4bab697.html","relUrl":"notes/8d3c8142-7481-40da-9a5c-69a3d4bab697.html"},{"doc":"Features","title":"Features","hpath":"dendron.features","content":"\n## Hierarchies\n\nDendron proposes **hierarchies** as the **human solution** to information overload. This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read [this blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html) for the extended rationale behind this.\n\nIn Dendron, you can quickly **lookup** related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply `.` delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. `github.com`).\n\nThe following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format.\n\n```\n- cli.tar.md\n- cli.tar.env.md\n- cli.curl.md\n- cli.dig.md\n```\n\n### Flexible structure\n\nWhereas notes can end up in a tangled mess when you only have backlinks and folders, Dendron has a flexible and emergent series of tools to help you structure your data. [[dendron.topic.hierarchies]] function as support beams, they help enforce the foundations of your knowledge base. Dendron encourages you to be flexible with your mental models by allowing you to [[refactor|dendron.topic.commands#refactor-hierarchy]] them. And once you've got a handle on a particular topic, [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]] can help you scale out to other domains and see patterns that you otherwise wouldn't.\n\n## Lookup\n\n**Lookup** is the process of finding a note by traversing its hierarchy.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n> Lookups are **quick**\n\nWhat's nice about using the `.` delimited format is that a note **can be** both **a file** (something that contains data) and **a folder** (something that contains other files) **at the same time**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-folder_and_file.gif)\n\n> You **can** be a file and have your folder **too**\n\nDendron uses fuzzy matching on paths so you don't have to type out the whole path.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-fuzzy.gif)\n\n> Lazyness is the key to success\n\nYou can use **lookup** to figure out what is true!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-bool.gif)\n\n## Schemas\n\nIf you're paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-closeup.jpg)\n\nThese icons indicate the **schema** associated with the note. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace.\n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n      - cmd\n      - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nSchemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-suggest.gif)\n\nThe `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n**Schema suggestions** don't show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at.\n\nThe nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-ignore.gif)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\nDendron will show you a `?` next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n## VS Code\n\nDendron is built on top of VSCode, the open-source IDE from Microsoft.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/code-banner.jpg)\n\nDendron runs as a plugin inside VSCode. If you use VSCode today, it means that all your current knowledge, settings and extensions will carry over into Dendron. If you don't, no sweat, because Dendron will create an optimal workspace with recommended settings and extensions when you first launch it.\n\n## Recommended Extensions\n\nSince Dendron runs on top of VSCode, it means that you also have access to thousands of extensions to customize Dendron exactly how you like it.\n\nBy default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.\n\n-   [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [wiki links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [backlinks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (think Roam)\n-   [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)\n    -   Quickly toggle bullet points\n    -   Easily generate URLs\n    -   Convert tabular data to tables\n-   [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n    -   [live markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n    -   [math](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/math) (KaTeX or MathJax)\n    -   [sequence diagrams](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/diagrams?id=mermaid) (mermaid)\n    -   [pandoc support](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/pandoc)\n    -   [code chunks](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk)\n    -   [presentations](https://rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/docs/presentation-intro.html)\n-   [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)\n    -   beautiful colors built using the [Material design system](https://material.io/)\n-   [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)\n    -   easily add images from your clipboard to your markdown files\n-   [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)\n    -   Spell Check\n\n## Fast and performant\n\nDendron operates completely on local data and is able serve your notes to you without ever having to pull from a server. That means there's no downtime. We index your notes so [[dendron.topic.lookup]] is fast and everything (and I mean [[everything|dendron.topic.keybindings]]) has keyboard shortcuts so you never have to leave the home row.\n\n## Local-first\n\nDid we mention we're local first? We'll never send your notes off your system unless you want to explicitly. We also have easy guides for syncing with Github or you can always use your own service (Dropbox, Onedrive) to sync your notes wherever you want. Because you own your data.\n\n## Extensible and open-source\n\nDendron is built into VSCode and can take advantage of all the extensions you've come to love. Whether you want vim keybindings, mermaid diagram support or snippet support, the extension ecosystem has you covered. And if you can't find something that you need, we also offer [[dendron.topic.hooks]] so you can build advanced workflows, right into Dendron.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe following extensions also work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default. You can download them separately to unlock additional functionality.\n\n-   [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) 🔍\n    -   Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n-   [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)\n    -   VIM key bindings 😍\n-   [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)\n    -   Bookmark lines within files\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4bb85c39-d8ac-48ad-a765-3f2a071f7bc9.html","relUrl":"notes/4bb85c39-d8ac-48ad-a765-3f2a071f7bc9.html"},{"doc":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","hpath":"dendron.faq","content":"\nAll the questions we thought you might ask.\n\n## General\n\n### What is a Dendron?\n\nA Dendron is many things.\n\n1. Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables.\n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n   ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/2880px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png)\n    - Image by Quasar Jarosz at English Wikipedia\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you organize, manage, publish, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\n\n### How is Dendron different from X note taking tool?\n\nSubstitute X with `roam|obsidian|foam|one note|evernote|...`\n\nAll note taking tools (try to) make it easy to get notes in. It's getting it back out again that's hard, and it **becomes harder** as you get more notes.\n\nWhether you are using notebooks tags, or backlinks, once you have more than a few hundred notes, you'll need to have some sort of structure in place (eg. naming convention, hierarchy, etc.) to keep track of them.\n\nDendron is a highly opinionated note taking tool that focuses on **hierarchal note taking**. It provides the freedom of Roam's _every note exists everywhere philosophy_, while layering on top **flexible hierarchies** to keep track of it all.\n\nWhile Dendron works with knowledge bases of any size, it really shines once you've accumulated a few hundred notes. I created it to handle my personal knowledge base of 20k+ markdown notes — Dendron lets me track and find any specific note in it in seconds. You can read more about Dendron's hierarchal approach to note taking [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html).\n\n### How is Dendron different from Roam?\n\nWhereas Roam is built around the idea of **bi-directional links** (and daily journals) which help you create notes without having to explicitly organize your notes, Dendron is built to help you organize notes without friction using **flexible hierarchies**.\n\nWe provide the tooling to create, enforce, and change these hierarchies at will. If you think of Roam as a graph database for notes, you can think of Dendron as Redis. To give you a sense of scale, Dendron is used to manage knowledge bases of +30K notes.\n\nSome additional features that set Dendron apart:\n\n-   Dendron allows you to compose your workspace with vaults (a vault is a collection of notes that can come from anywhere) from any number of sources\n-   Dendron is based on plain text (Dendron-flavored) markdown (exportable to regular markdown or any other format)\n-   Dendron is integrated into VSCode\n-   Dendron allows for easy publishing public/private content to any platform that can host a static site (and we're rolling out our own publishing platform to help people publish with additional access controls)\n\n### How does Dendron help me track my notes?\n\n1. Dendron organizes and collapse all your notes into managable chunks using [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]].\n2. Dendron helps you manage your hiearchies using [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]]\n3. Dendron gets out of your way when you're working with your notes during [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\nDendron's secret sauce is that it provides the necessary tooling for you to work with hierarichal notes. While hierarchies have traditionally (and justifiably) gotten a bad reputation, I would argue that this is because the **tooling** around hierarchies were bad, not because hierarchies themselves are bad.\n\nHierarchies are one of the most effective ways that **both humans and computers** process large amount of information (there's a reason why almost every database is built from a variation of the [b-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)). You can find further details about hierarchies in this [blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html)\n\n### Is Dendron free? Will it stay free?\n\nDendron, the client, is free and will always remain free. It is also open source so anyone is free to make their own fork of Dendron.\n\nThat being said, I'm all in on Dendron and this is my full time gig. I want to make sure that developing Dendron remains sustainable. To that end, I plan on introducing value add server side functionality that folks may pay for. Examples of paid for features include:\n\n-   private hosting (for folks who want to publish but not use github pages or want to add authentication)\n-   enterprisy things\n    -   eg. on premise installations of Dendron with single sign on, active directory, and fine grained permissions\n-   offering private subscription based vaults (eg. think [substack](https://substack.com) but having people subscribe to vaults instead of newsletters )\n-   server side IFTTT like functionality (eg. everytime I add an entry to airtable, add a note to Dendron)\n\nPaid for features will be 100% optional and will not be necessary for any client side functionality in Dendron.\n\n### Why is Dendron built on top of VSCode?\n\nAs with all things, its a matter of tradeoffs. Dendron started its life as a standalone app (eg. think Obsidian) but I quickly realized I was spending most of my time building undifferentiated editor scaffolding instead of focusing on the hierarchies and schemas that made Dendron unique.\n\nI wanted to spend more time building out features that supported Dendron's [hiearchy first approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to note taking which is what led me to re-write it for VSCode.\n\nThat being said, the core dendron engine is not vscode specific and there are folks that are experimenting with porting it over to other editors (eg. sublime, vim). We also have plans for a standalone editor in the future (most likely, this will be a fork of VSCode optimized for note taking)\n\n## Working with Notes\n\n### Why markdown?\n\nMarkdown lets you write text in a simple human readable notation that is platform independent. You don't need to have microsoft word to read a markdown file and now a days, all new note taking tools support importing and displaying markdown.\n\nFor more context, you can see the original markdown declaration [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n\n### Can I use Dendron with existing notes?\n\nYou can use Dendron with existing repositories of markdown notes.\n\nOpen the `Command Palette` in vscode and use the `Dendron: Change Workspace` command. It will ask you for a folder path as input.\n\nDendron will create a `dendron.code-workspace` file in specified directory and then open the workspace (if a workspace file already exists, it will use that). It will also create a `root.md` file in that directory if it doesn't exist (currently this is part of the internal working of dendron).\n\nDendron **does not** delete or overwrite any files during the **Change Workspace** operation.\n\n### How do I save?\n\nDendron automatically saves when you change focus (switch tabs or applications). You can also manually save using `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` depending on your operating system\n\n### How do I go back to the previous note?\n\nThere are 3 ways to go back to my previous note:\n\n1. `ctrl-tab` (go to previous tab)\n2. click on the previous tab\n3. using the open editors pane\n\n-   NOTE: to have more than a single tab show, you need to have the following settings\n\n```json\n{\n    \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false,\n    \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": true\n}\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.go-back.gif)\n\n## Working with Hierarchies\n\n### How should I name a note?\n\nThere are no rigid requirements on note naming in Dendron, other than the dots in the file name are used to construct the [[note hierarchy|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]. However, the recommended way is to use all lowercase letters, replace spaces with `-`-mark and remove any special characters. Thus e.g. `John's amazing garage` becomes `johns-amazing-garage`.\n\nAlso, remember that you will use the note [[lookup-feature|dendron.topic.lookup]] to find notes quickly, and the lookup will use the names of the files. Thus try to name the files using the words that you are likely to use to find the note.\n\n### What kind of note hierarchy should I create?\n\nA good guideline is to start with a relatively flat hierarchy (even just a single note in the root!) and add topics as headings into those notes. When notes grow to the point that you have to start scrolling, it’s time to consider if it would be beneficial to split those notes. At that point, you probably already have some idea how the thoughts are placed in your mind - try to mimic that also with the hierarchy.\n\nIf you have a hard time deciding which ideas belong closer to root, think which of those ideas are more fundamental in your thinking. As an example, a note related to coding in Excel, should it be named as `code.excel` or `excel.code`? This could be resolved by thinking if you will write more about coding where Excel is just one example, or more about Excel, where coding is only one example. In case you think that both `excel.code` and `code.excel` are equal and both should be created, you could also make one of them a “master note” and [[refer|dendron.topic.refs]] to it from the other note.\n\n### Do I have to use hierarchies? What if I want to use another approach?\n\nDespite our emphasis on hierarchies, Dendron also supports non-hierarchal ways of organizing notes (eg. backlinks, zettelkasten, etc).\n\nYou can, and are encouraged to, combine these other workflows with Dendron hierarchies in order to create your own workflow that takes the best parts of each system!\n\n### What if I have a note that belongs in multiple hierarchies?\n\nThis comes up a lot especially when your dealing with organizing collections of things, like music or books. There are a few approaches we recommend here.\n\n1. Use [[tags|dendron.topic.tags]]. Tags work best with categorical data. If you use **Dendron Tags** (aka they're really hierarchies), then you have the added advantage of being able to refactor and track your tags using Dendron's existing hierarchal tooling.\n2. Use alias nodes. This is an [upcoming feature](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/128) that will allow you to put a node under multiple hierarchies.\n\n### Hierarchies add too much friction\n\nThe hierarchy adds friction but the idea is that the friction (eg. hierarchy) is not a bug but the reason why dendron works with thousands of notes.\n\nThe analogy to think about is excel: while putting your numbers inside the structure of a spreadsheet might not be the most straightforward way of getting to a numerical solution, its use becomes indispensable once you deal with a significant amount ofnumbers.\n\nThe way to think about dendron is that its not like google where you type a question and try to find an answer - until we get true AI, this simply doesn't work for personal knowledge. Rather, Dendron helps you organize your notes so you can reference the information you need to answer your own questions.\n\n### Hierarchies are too rigid\n\nTraditional hierarchies are like straight jackets - they are confining and force you down a certain path once set. The hierarchies in Dendron are more like support beams - they help enforce the foundation of your knowledge base. Dendron encourages you to be flexible with your mental models (represented as hierarchies in Dendron) and change them over time. \n\nCurrent tools for Zettelkasten or Notes you can think of as a *one level hierarchy* that is strung together by links. Dendron provides that but also lets you go deeper by building out multi-level hierarchies when it is useful to do so. \n\n### Will Dendron ever support folders?\n\nIt is possible though most of the approaches we've thought of would take a large amount of effort and deliver questionable benefit on top of what's already planned (for more info, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)). \n\nIf you want the ability to collapse folders, you can use the [[dendron tree view|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]]. For existing folder based notes and assets, you can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.import]] to import them into Dendron.\n\nAt the end of the day, folders are meant to be an implementation detail for dendron. The underlying primitive of a note is an object that has metadata, content, and links. You can think of dendron as a flat file based database and lookup and the tree view as the UI to said database. For use cases involving external tools that require folders, you'll soon be able to use the [[markdown export pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.export]] to do just that.\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\n### What is the deal with schemas? Do I need to use them?\n\nThe short answer is no, you don't **need** to use schemas. That being said, schemas can help you manage your notes, especially as you collect more of them.\n\nIf you're familiar with typescript - Dendron schemas are similar to the types offered by typescript. You can compile your typescript code into javascript even if the types don't match (subject to your tsconfig). Types help make your projects maintainable, especially as they grow.\n\nCurrently, Dendron will do is show you an indicator if your schema doesn't match. In the future, we'll have a strict mode where we will actually prevent you from creating notes that don't match your schema.\n\nSchemas at the end of the day help you construct consistent hierarchies for your notes. Consistent hierarchies alleviate the cognitive overhead of needing to understand and track N things where N can be very big. Instead, you can construct a single schema that encompasses the common areas of all N things.\n\nBut even if you don't have a lot of notes, schemas are helpful because they provide extra features [like templating](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates) and [auto complete](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#why-use-schemas).\n\n<!--\nThis allows you to quickly reference anything within your hierarchy because they all have the same shape. It also helps with understanding a topic - I (Kevin, Dendron author) find my schema for a domain tends to reflect my mental model for said domain as well.\n\nFor example, I'm using nodejs and need to access a file. I have no idea what the builtin/recommended library for file access is. Instead of having to dig up [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra), I can navigate to `l.node.file` and see my notes on the best way to work with files. You can replace node with any other programming language. Now I have a general way of referencing file access for all languages without needing to remember the specific implementation detail of any of them.\n-->\n\n## Finding Notes\n\n### Can I do filter by the metadata in Dendron?\n\nMetadata is currently under utilized because we don't have a built in way of easily querying by it. We currently have [this issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152) tracking the progress of advanced query work.\ngg\nIn the future, we want to support:\n\n-   querying by custom frontmatter attributes: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152>\n-   query by attributes with logical operators: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159>\n\nWe also want to support some subset of the queries as note references so that the results can be included in page.\n\n### Can I autocomplete an hierarchy?\n\nSee this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/490).\n\nTLDR: vscode doesn't expose tab completion via API. There are two alternatives we're currently considering:\n\n-   overload the `enter` command, one press to autocomplete, two presses to select\n-   replace the lookup component with a webview\n\n## Publishing\n![[dendron://dendron-site/dendron.topic.publishing.faq]]\n\n## Other\n\n### How to launch dendron with most recent vault quickly?\n\nIn menu bar of VSCode, select `File` -> `New Window` and click the Dendron workspace in Recent section of the Welcome tab.\n\n### Why are there `root` files in my notes?\n\nWhen you initialize a vault, `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` get created inside each vault.\n\nThey serve as the \"roots\" of your vault for your notes and schema respectively.\n\nroot.md is used as the parent of all hierarchies, root.schema as the parent of all schemas\n\nroot.md is what shows up when you do a lookup with an empty line \"\"\n\nroot.schema.yml is a schema that is global for all hierarchies (normally, a schema is scoped to a particular hierarchy)\n\nNow this isn't required per-say, we could just do away with **root** notes and stick strictly to hierarchies and this might be an option in the future but this is the reasoning at the current time\n\nps. root.schema.yml doesn't work right now as described in the sense that we haven't implemented global schemas yet\n\n### Can I use a dark theme for the markdown preview?\n\nYes. There's a setting called `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` that you can set which has a list of default themes, including dark themes.\n\n### Can I customize the markdown preview CSS?\n\nYes. Read [this](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css) for more information.\n\n### Is there a list of keyboard shortcuts I can see?\n\nDendron has a list of keyboard shortcuts that you can access using `Dendron: Show Help` command. Note that these only show the commands that come with the Dendron Plugin but not its bundled extensions. We currently have an open [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/148) to list all shortcuts on one page.\n\n### Why are there '+' signs next to the notes in the Tree View?\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.plus-sign.jpg)\n\nThe reason you see this is because Dendron will create [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]] notes when creating notes that have parents that don't exist. These notes are placeholders and will only be visible in the Dendron Tree View with a `+` sign next to the name. The reason we do stubs is because we don't want to litter your file system with empty files. Stubs are a compromise - they let you see the hierarchy of your newly created notes without forcing you to create intermediary files.\n\n### Why custom markdown preview instead of the VSC one?\n\nOur custom markdown preview gives us much more functionality then the vscode one -> eg. note references, checkboxes, etc.\n\nIn addition, the markdown preview that Dendron uses is platform agnostic (eg. it's also available on atom). This means that other editors could potentially adopt it as well.\n\n### VSCode Snippets are not working in Frontmatter\n\nThe default snippets are scoped to markdown. You can create [global snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) file to have snippets that work across all languages.\n\n### The extension 'Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced' took a very long time to complete its last operation\n\nThis is a known issue whenever we release a new version of the preview (mostly because its uncompressed javascript). Moving forward, we'll be removing the dependency on an external plugin and integrating Dendron's markdown features into vscode's native markdown preview in the near future.\n\n### I want to push all my note to my git repository periodically\n\nThis can be done with some extensions that are external to Dendron such as:\n\n1. [autogit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zeitnergmbh.auto-git)\n2. [gitdoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc)\n3.

They are easily identifiable:\n\n| State                   | What your GitHub issue looks like                        |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Closed                  | matches the query `is:closed`                            |\n| Pending Community Input | Has a `status.help-wanted` or `status.info-needed` label |\n| Accepted                | Has a milestone assigned (that's not `Backlog`)          |\n\n## Closing Issues\n\nWe close issues for the following reasons:\n\n| Reason                                               | Label                |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| The issue is obsolete or already fixed.              |                      |\n| We didn't get the information we need within 7 days. | `status.info-needed` |\n| It's a duplicate of another issue.                   | `status.duplicate`   |\n| What is described is the designed behavior.          | `status.by-design`   |\n| The issue is tracked in a repository we rely on.     | `status.upstream`    |\n\nWe close issues by assigning a label, adding a comment and closing the issue.\n\n## Requesting Information\n\nIf an issue misses information that we need to understand the issue, we assign the `status.info-needed` label.\n\n[This bot](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.github/no-response.yml) is monitoring all issues labeled `status.info-needed`. If we don't receive the needed information within 7 days the bot closes the issue.\n\n## Categorizing Issues\n\nEach issue must have a **type** label.\n\n| Type                                                                          | Description                                                            |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`bug`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.bug)                 | the implementation of a feature is not correct                         |\n| [`enhancement`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.enhancement) | Extension to a previously shipped feature. Minor functionality update. |\n| [`feature`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.feature)         | New functionality                                                      |\n| [`epic`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.epic)               | Umbrella issues representing significant customer impact               |\n|                                                                               |\n\n## Assigning Feature Areas\n\nEach issue will also have an **area** label, each representing a stage in the customer journey. This is also loosely how we choose to work on backlog issues.\n\n-   area.onboard\n-   area.create\n-   area.retrieve\n-   area.structure\n-   area.publish\n\n## Assigning a Milestone\n\nIn addition to [milestones](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/milestones) representing our weekly iterations and releases such as **`v42`** (representing the release of Dendron version 0.42.0 ), we have two milestones with special meaning:\n\n-   Issues assigned to **`Backlog`**: Our team is in favor of implementing the feature request/fix the issue. The issue is not yet assigned to a concrete iteration. If and when a Backlog item is scheduled for a concrete iteration depends on how well the issue aligns with our **[[roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]**. We review and update our roadmap at least every quarter. The Backlog helps us shaping our Roadmap but it is not the only source of input. Therefore, some Backlog items will be closed once it becomes clear that they do not align with our Roadmap.\n-   Issues assigned to **`Up Next`**: Our team wants to implement the feature/fix the issue. The issue is on the short list to be assigned to a concrete iteration. Note: **`Up Next`** is used sparsely. More commonly, issues go from **`Backlog`** or Triage directly to concrete iterations.\n\n## Asking for Help\n\nWe label **`Backlog`**issues, particularly feature requests, that we encourage the community to take up with `status.help-wanted`. If issues are suitable for beginners we may add the `size.small` label and add code pointers that help beginners to get started with a PR.\n\nPlease note, we will primarily accept PRs for issues that are accepted, i.e. have a milestone assigned (including `Backlog`).\n\n## Type-specific Characteristics / Triaging\n\n### Managing Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests like all issues are a means of communication between all of us as members of the Dendron community. Thus, in principle, we could keep all feature requests open no matter what will happen to the feature they describe. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to understand what has a realistic chance to ever make it into the repository. We therefore close feature requests we cannot address while we assign feature requests we don't plan to address in the near-future to the **`Backlog`** milestone.\n\nIf you are the author of a feature request you might not like that we close or don't plan to address your request asap. But, be assured, we love all of your input. Please don't take personal offense when we close or assign the **`Backlog`/`status.help-wanted`** milestone to your issue :peace_symbol:. If you feel your feature request deserves to stay open, improve your use case and ping us or gather more up-votes (our community [in Discord](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ) is a good source of our prioritization).\n\n### Up-voting a Feature Request\n\nWhen we refer to \"up-voting\" a feature request, we specifically mean adding a GitHub `+1`/\"👍\" reaction to the issue description. In the GitHub UI this looks like so:\n<img width=\"867\" alt=\"GitHub UI for a issue with a +1 reaction\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8586769/87996982-b0568c80-caa8-11ea-87b8-a01371e6e338.png\">\n\n## Community Request On Planning (CROP for short)\n\nEvery week, we post three issues in the [#feedback](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126) channel. These are a combination of issues that are:\n\n1. Requested by the community (with >5 upvotes)\n2. New issues that people have recently expressed interest in.\n3. Feasible to do (or make substantial progress) within a week\n\nWe take a quick poll over the weekend (opens Friday and closes on Monday) and we commit to delivering or making substantial progress on the issue by the next release (next Monday). If you're particularly interested in an issue being included as part of next week's CROP, that's good feedback too and we'll do our best to honor your requests. Don't worry if an issue doesn't make it, we have a weekly rotation of issues so it's bound to come back in soon.\n\n## [Lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\n\nThis section is both inspired by and borrows heavily from the following project:\n\n-   [vscode triage process](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/06751374-7982-4df2-b30b-92b10aba733a.html","relUrl":"notes/06751374-7982-4df2-b30b-92b10aba733a.html"},{"doc":"Bots","title":"Bots","hpath":"dendron.dev.triage.bots","content":"\nIn order for us to maintain triage hygiene, we've enabled bots in the Dendron repos.\n\n## No Response Bot\n\nSometimes an issue gets filed that needs more information just to be actionable by our repo maintainers. In this case, please tag the issue with `status.info-needed`. This will notify the no response bot that if we don't hear back from the original filer for a week, it can close the issue with a comment.\n\nPlease see the [config file](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.github/no-response.yml) for the latest parameters we're using.\n\n<!-- ## Stale issue bot\n\nEvery repo starts to accumulate cruft which eventually slows down planning and execution since we're not sure if issues still need work. The stale issue bot is intended to identify issues that haven't had any activity for `x` days and will allow the triage team to decide whether they're still valid. Note: there's a cooldown period between an issue marked \"won't fix\" and when it's actually closed. This gives us about a week to go through and decide if the issue continues to be actionable.\n\nPlease see the [config file](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.github/stale.yml) for the latest parameters we're using.\n -->\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4e14f66f-4df2-4414-8e99-f37159de0f61.html","relUrl":"notes/4e14f66f-4df2-4414-8e99-f37159de0f61.html"},{"doc":"Tools","title":"Tools","hpath":"dendron.dev.tools","content":"\n\n## Summary\n\nUseful tools when working with Dendron\n\n### Postman\n\n- [Postman | The Collaboration Platform for API Development](https://www.postman.com/)\n\nIt's just `curl` but using postman is useful when doing lots of things at once\n\n\n### SourceTree\n- [url](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)\n\nPretty graphical git \n\n/Users/kevinlin/Dropbox/Apps/Noah/workspaces/org-workspace/repos/dendron-site/vault/pro.dendron-next-server.dev.md\n\n### NGrok\n\nUseful if you are running Dendron on a remote machine.

You can see our styling options [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.eslintrc.js#L29:L29)\n\n\n\n## Time\n\nWe use [`luxon`](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html) for all time related tasks. This is the successor of [`moment.js`](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/moment-js-thank-you-for-your-service/)\n\n\n## Typescript\n\n### prefer using `type` over `interface`\n\n- types and interfaces are mostly interchangable, `types` are a bit more flexible and so we've standardized on using it\n- see official typescript docs [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces)\n\n```ts\n// good\ntype Foo {\n\n}\n\n// boad\ninterface Foo {\n}\n\n```\n\n### prefer using `async/await` and `Promises` over callbacks\n\nMakes code more readable\n\n### prefer using object notation for methods ith multiple arguments\n\nThis makes code easier to refactor\n\n```ts\n// good\nfunction foo(opts: {arg1: string, arg2: string}) {\n\n}\n// bad\nfunction foo(arg1: string, arg2: string) {\n}\n```\n\n### prefer `undefined` and `null` over implicitly incorrect values\n\nType checking can warn you about a potentially undefined value, but not a value that's just implied to be undefined like `\"\"` or `-1`.\n\n```ts\n//good\nfunction findSomething(...) {\n  if (...) return 4;\n  return undefined; // not found!\n}\n// bad\nfunction findSomething(...) {\n  if (...) return 4;\n  return -1; // not found!\n}\n```\n\n### prefer compile time checks for exhaustive patterns\n\nIf you have a `switch` or a chain of `if ... else if` statements where you check all possible cases, add a static assertion so that if a revision breaks this in the future it will be easily caught.\n\n```ts\nimport { assertUnreachable } from \"@dendronhq/common-all\";\n\ntype MyOptions = \"one\" | \"two\";\n\n// bad\nfunction myFunction(var: MyOptions) {\n  if (var === \"one\") {/* ... */}\n  else {/* ... */}\n}\n\n// good\nfunction myFunction(var: MyOptions) {\n  if (var === \"one\") {/* ... */}\n  else if (var === \"two\") {/* ... */}\n  else assertUnreachable(var);\n}\n```\n\nThis works with properties within objects (e.g. `node.type`) too! One hint is that if the type of the object shows up as `never` in the editor, then you can use this assertion.\n\n### prefer `forEach` when iterating through an array\n\nThis is more concise and avoids some [unexpected behaviors](https://thecodebarbarian.com/for-vs-for-each-vs-for-in-vs-for-of-in-javascript.html) that can arise from other methods of iteration.\n\n```ts\n// good\n[1,2,3].forEach(elem => console.log(elem))\n\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/773e0b5a-510f-4c21-acf4-2d1ab3ed741e.html","relUrl":"notes/773e0b5a-510f-4c21-acf4-2d1ab3ed741e.html"},{"doc":"Setup","title":"Setup","hpath":"dendron.dev.setup","content":"\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Requirements\n\nBefore you begin, you need to make sure to have the following SDKs and tools:\n\n- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)\n  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)\n- yarn\n  - `npm install -g yarn`\n- lerna\n  - `npm install -g lerna`\n- a different instance of VSCode\n  - because debugging VSCode by default loads up all extensions that are installed, you'll have issues trying to develop Dendron if you also have VSCode installed . the workaround is to install an alternative flavor of vscode (eg. [insider edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)) to use for development \n\n### 2. Clone \n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron.git\ncd dendron\n```\n\n### 3. Install Dependencies and Build\n```bash\n# this should install all dependencies\nyarn init\n\n# if the above script errors out, you can diagnose the issue and run the following scripts sequentially dependeing on where the error occured\nyarn # install package root dependencies\nyarn bootstrap:bootstrap # install package dependencise\nyarn bootstrap:build  # build package dependencies\n```\n\n### 4. Editing (the plugin)\nAt the root of the monorepo, open `dendron-main.code-workspace`. Open this with VSCode to start editing. While its not required to use VSCode, most of the helper scripts in this repository are created with VSCode in mind so using it will make development significantly easier.\n\n### 5. Start Debugging (the plugin)\n\n- NOTE: you don't need to do this if you are not directly working on the extension (eg. you're working on the [[server|pkg.dendron-next-server]])\n\nTo start an instance of the Dendron with the Debugger, Run `Extension (plugin-core)` from the debug panel in vscode\n\n![debugger](/assets/images/start_debugger.gif)\n\n_Note: Running via Run -> Start Debugging will not work unless you've previously targeted `Extension (plugin-core)`_\n\n### 6. Remote Development (optional)\n\nIf you are developing Dendron in a remote environment using VSCode, see additional instructions [[here|dendron.dev.remote]].\n\n\n## Normal Workflow\n\n1. Checkout a feature branch for your task\n1. Work on code\n1. Submit a [[pull Request|dendron.dev.pull-request]] \n\n## Logging\n\nLogs are important for debugging and we should strive to have logs that will give enough information that we can debug any errors from the logs alone. Because we're dealing with users personal notes, we also need to ensure not to log any sensitive information.\n\nIf you need to log data, use one of the following loggers depending on what package you are in:\n- plugin-core: use [Logger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/logger.ts#L22:L22)\n- react component: use [createLogger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-frontend/src/utils/logger.ts#L3:L3) in common-frontend\n- everything else: use [createLogger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-server/src/logger.ts#L36:L36) in common-server\n\nAlso note that many objects (eg. commands, pods, etc), have an instance of the logger attached to them. You should use them whenever available. They are usually attached as a `.L` or `.logger` property. \n- pods have loggers attached in `this.L`\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n  - Do not use `console.log` to log data\n  - Raw note objects contain note content which we never want to log. Instead, use [`NoteUtils.toLogObj`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-kevin/packages/common-all/src/dnode.ts#L803:L803) which strips out sensitive fields to the logger. \n\n## Exceptions\n\nWhen handling a Dendron specific error, use the [DendronError](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-joshi/packages/common-all/src/error.ts#L38:L38) class\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n  - when returning an error from the server, note that you'll need to convert the error to a plain object using [error2PlainObject](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/error.ts#L110)\n  - when displaying an error in a string, you'll need to convert the error using [stringifyError](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/error.ts#L106:L106)\n  - whenever possible, attach a [status](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/constants.ts#L18:L18) to an error\n  - whenever possible, attach a [severity](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/constants.ts#L45) to an error\n\n## Project Specific Docs\n### Working with the API Server\n\nDendron connects to a local express server which is responsible for indexing your notes. This express server also serves up static files generated by [[Dendron Next Server|pkg.dendron-next-server]]. \n\nDendron compiles the static assets from the next server to the express server during publication so that everything is bundled when published. When you are developing, you can launch the next server independently for faster development. You can follow the instructions [[here|pkg.dendron-next-server.quickstart]] to start the next-server.\n\nTo start Dendron with the next server active, you can set the following value in `dendron.yml`\n\n```yml\ndev:\n  nextServerUrl: \"http://localhost:3000\"\n```\n\n### Working with the CLI\n\nSymlink `dendron` \n\n```sh\ncd packages/dendorn-cli\nnpm link\n\nnpm link -g @dendronhq/dendron-cli\n```\n\n## Advanced\n\n### Working with Verdaccio\n\n[Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) is an open source local NPM registry. We use it to test out publishing and link together projects internally before publishing\n\n```\nnpm install -g verdaccio\n```\n\n- switch to local npm\n```sh\n# source helpers \n. bootstrap/scripts/helpers.sh\n# change registry to local endpoint\nsetRegLocal\n# run local endpoint\nverdaccio\n```\n\n- create a user\n```sh\nnpm login {user}\n# follow login instructions\n# this allows you to run `npm publish`\nCTRL+C\n```\n\n\n- NOTE: only run verdaccio when you need to test publishing. otherwise, this will pollute the `yarn.lock` file with `localhost` entries which will fail in CI/CD\n\n```sh\n# switch back to remote endpoint\nsetRegRemote\n```\n\n\n### Publishing Packages Locally\n\nAfter you setup a local npm registry, you can run the following commands to publish locally\n\n```sh\nlerna publish from-package --ignore-scripts\n# updates meta.json with latest package versions\nnode bootstrap/scripts/genMeta.js\n```\n\n### Linking all Packages\n\nThis goes over symlinking all packages locally. This requires that the `meta.json` file be generated. It is created as part of `yarn lerna:bootstrap`.\n\n```sh\nnode bootstrap/scripts/linkAll.js\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Watch Monorepo\n\nTo continuously compile all dependencies, run the following\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n\n### Adding dependencies\n\nWhen you are merging new changes, note that new dependencies and sometimes packages will be installed. \n\n#### New Dependencies\n```sh\n# install all new dependencies\nlerna bootstrap\n```\n\n#### New Package in Dendron Mono Repo\nAdding new packages is a rarer event but might require a workspace rebuild\n\n```sh\n# clean up old files (this might take a few minutes)\n./bootstrap/scripts/cleanup.sh\n\n# install all dependencies\nlerna bootstrap\n\n# build all dependencies\n./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh\n```\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Something went wrong during the build\n\nIn case something something goes wrong with a build step or you want to save time by not running everything, `init.sh` is just a thin wrapper around the following scripts, each of which can be run individually\n\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh: `lerna bootstrap all packages`\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh: `lerna build all packages`\n\n### Changes not showing up in Dendron\n\n1. Are you using the `Run extension` command on the debugger panel to test dendron? \n\n2. If you have one vscode instance which you have dendron installed and are also doing dendron development on, you might get a version conflict. in that case, use `Run extension with plugin disabled` in the debugger panel (or use a different version of vscode to run dendron vs develop)\n\n### Husky Hooks not running\n\nMake sure you run `yarn` at the root of your workspace \n\n## Getting Help\n\nDendron is actively being developed and it could be quite confusing to start developing for the first time. In this case, we recommend asking for help with whatever blockers you might have with setting up or understanding part of the codebase.\n\nGenerally, a member of the Dendron team or the community will chime in for help if you post a specific question in the `#dev` channel in our Discord server.\n\nFor more information, check out our handbook entry on `Getting help for development` described [here](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/bHWjVTtdOCMMRd2_QD0tb.html)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html","relUrl":"notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html"},{"doc":"Remote","title":"Remote","hpath":"dendron.dev.remote","content":"\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen developing in VSCode, you can use its [remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to ssh into another machine but keep VSCode as your development frontend.\n\nWhile installation intsructions are the same, there are some differences when running and testing code which are documented here.\n\n## Developing\n\n### Running Plugin Remotely\n\nUse the `Run Extension:Remote` launch task to start the extension. \n\n## QA\n\n### Running All Plugin Tests\n\nThis works the same as in local development\n\n### Running a single Plugin Test\n\nYou'll need to update the following file `src/test/suite-integ/index.ts`.

Open the debug view\n2. Run `Extension Integ Tests` in the dropdown\n\n## Run Specific Test\n\n### Run a specific test for Dendron Plugin\n\n1. Open a test inside 'src/test/suite-integ/' from `plugin-core`\n2. Run the build task `Extension Integ Tests - File` \n\n### Run a specific test from non-dendron plugin package\n\n1. Go to file\n2. Use command prompt and run `> Tasks: Run tasks`\n3. Find the appropriate package and run `> npm:test:watch engine-test-utils`\n  - NOTE: most tests are consolidated in `engine-test-utils`. you can find them in `engine-test-utils/src/__tests__`\n\n## Writing Tests\n\nAll packages have tests written in `jest` except plugin-core. these tests use `mocha` assertion because vscode has a special test harness built around `mocha`  \n\n### Plugin Tests\n\n- NOTE: mocha will mark a test as a success if you return a promise. This is why we use callback style version of the tests\n\n```ts\n// good\ndescribe(\"foo\", function() {\n  test(\"does foo\", function(done) {\n    ...\n    done();\n  });\n});\n\n// bad\ndescribe(\"foo\", function() {\n  test(\"does foo\", async function( ) {\n    ...\n  });\n});\n```\n\nYou can see an example of a test [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-kevin/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/CopyNoteURL.ts#L1:L1)\n\nAlso, consider enabling \"Uncaught Exceptions\" under \"Breakpoints\" when running tests. Otherwise, if you forget to `await` a function that returns a promise and that function throws an exception, the test will appear to pass even though an exception was thrown.\n\n### Test Workspace\n\nIf you want to use a workspace to test changes on the workspace at `{ROOT}/test-workspace`\n\nNote that this workspace is currently configured to be used with launching a engine server from the command line. \n\nRemove the following lines in `dendron.yml` to launch it without the CLI engine server\n\n```yml\ndev:\n    nextServerUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'\n    engineServerPort: 3005\n```\n\n### Stubs\nWe use [sinonjs](https://sinonjs.org/) to stub test methods. \n\nIf you use sinon, don't forget to call `sinon.restore` so that stubs don't leak into subsequent tests.\n\nWhen stubbing tests in the plugin, we following the following pattern\n```ts\nsuite(\"some test\", function() {\n  let ctx: vscode.ExtensionContext;\n  ctx = setupBeforeAfter(this, {\n    afterHook: () => {\n      sinon.restore();\n    },\n  });\n\n  it(\"test\", (done) => {\n    sinon.stub(...);\n    done();\n  });\n\n})\n```\n\nWhen stubbing test any other code, add an `afterEach` block.\n```ts\nafterEach(()=> {\n  sinon.restore()\n});\n```\n\n\n## Debugging Tests\n\nYou can put a breakpoint directly in any code that's part of `plugin-core` and it'll break at those points\n\n> Kevin's Aside: If you need to debug a related package, I haven't found a good way to put a break point. Instead, I manually insert a `debugger` statement and vscode will break. Don't forget to remove the `debugger` statement \n\n### Git Related Tests\n\nAny tests that involve setting up git should use [GitTestUtils](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-kevin/packages/engine-test-utils/src/utils.ts#L22:L22). This will help you create a git workspace with necessary commit history. \n\nYou can see it being used [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-kevin/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/workspace.spec.ts#L21:L21).\n\nIf a tests involve a remote git repository, use `tmpDir` to setup a *local remote*. Use `GitTestUtils` to create a repo and then push an dpull to the local remote.\n\n### Engine Test\n\n- pre-req:\n  - read over the overall [[design|dendron.dev.design#overview]] for Dendron \n\nTesting the engine in Dendron involves a little bit of setup because:\n\n- it requires initializing the engine and seeding it with the right fixture for the test\n- it might require the same functionality be tested in multiple environments (plugin, CLI, server, engine, etc)\n- it might require using multiple test runners (dendron uses `jest` for all tests except for the [[dendron plugin|dendron.dev.design#dendron-plugin]] which uses [[mocha|pkg.dendron-plugin.qa#test-runner]])\n\nBecause of the aforementioned issues, we've created the following two classes to make testing easier and re-usable across environments.\n\n#### runEngineTest\n\n- setup a mock dendron environment\n\n- initialize the dendron engine\n\n- optionally seed engine with a preset\n\n- NOTE: there are currently multiple versions of this which track multiple generations of engine design\n  - the most current version is `runEngineTestV5`\n  - see example of usage [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/site.spec.ts#L84:L84)\n\n#### TestPresetEntry\n\n- [code](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-test-utils/src/utilsv2.ts#L48:L48)\n\n- this helps us create a `TestPreset` which is to be used with `runEngineTest`\n\n- lets you add different lifecycle hooks as the engine is beign initialized\n\n- NOTE: there are currently multiple versions of this\n  - the most current version is `TestPresetEntryV4`\n\n## Cook\n\n### Stubbing dendron.yml in a test\n![[pkg.engine-test-utils.cook#stubbing-dendronyml-in-a-test]]\n\n### Creating a mock note\n\nsee [this](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev-kevin/packages/common-test-utils/src/noteUtils.ts#L55:L55)\n\n### Updating test snapshots\n\nWe make frequent use of jest [snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) in our testing. These snapshots will fail the test if the output of a command changes. If you intend to change the output, run the following command:\n\n1. Use command prompt and run `> Tasks: Run tasks`\n2.

Choi](https://github.com/hikchoi/cerebrarium) for the below notes\n\n## Session goal\n- Add a test for MarkdownPublishPod\n- Show how tests are set up for Dendron\n\n## watch\n\n```bash\ncd bootstrap/scripts\n./watch.sh\n```\n- Dendron is made up of a multiple typescript projects\n- This script will watch all of them and compile them when you make change to the code.\n\n---\n\n## Testing in Dendron\n\n- All tests are managed with jest.\n    - Except the plugin itself, which uses mocha\n        - mocha is very well integrated into VSCode's [test harness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_harness)\n- Any test code that are not testing plugin functionality are\n    - located in the `__tests__` directory\n    - in the file name formatted `TestName.spec.ts`\n- To run a test, use VSCode tasks\n    - `cmd` + `shift` + `p`, -> `Task: Run Task` in the command palette\n    - Select the appropriate task to run.\n        - These are vscode wrappers around bash scripts.\n    - In our case, we want to test `MarkdownPod.spec.ts`\n    - Type `npm:test:watch` in the task comman palette\n    - There will be a number of selections, marked with which project's test it will be running.\n        - Select the one marked with `pods-core`, as we are testing pods today.\n    - This will open a terminal and run `jest --watch` on the specific test we are interested in.\n        - Now jest will run all the tests for you every time you change your test code\n- Writing new tests\n    - Start a new [describe block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#describename-fn), and give it an appropriate name.\n    - Write a new test case.\n        - Use `runEngineTest`\n            - Multiple versions of this exists\n            - Make sure you import the right version of this.\n                - This is a typescript thing (?)\n        - There are preset scenarios for testing\n            - These are `PreSetupHookFunctions`\n            - They set up hard-coded notes in a vault so that they can be used in a test\n    - Quick jest tip: use snapshots to grab a test result (something long that you don't really want to construct manually), and use that for your assertions\n        - These can be found in `__tests__/__snapshots__`\n        - Don't forget to remove the snapshot code for the final test code if it isn't necessary.\n    - Clean up any unused code / warnings\n- After writing all the tests, check again by running the entire test suite\n    - Run `Test: bootstrap` found under `Task: Run Task`\n        - This will all tests in all packages.\n        - We want to do this before commiting because Dendron is a mono-repo, and most packages have dependencies on each other.\n        - We want to make sure our changes aren't breaking something elsewhere.\n        - Github action that will automatically do this for every push will be coming soon.\n- If you want to be more careful, you can also test the plugin itself at this point.\n    - The above step tests every single package that is not a plugin.\n    - To run tests for the plugin itself, run `Extension Integ Tests (plugin-core)`, which can be found in the Run pane.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/bf26c697-3e70-4e34-b15d-ef40c4b7d429.html","relUrl":"notes/bf26c697-3e70-4e34-b15d-ef40c4b7d429.html"},{"doc":"Pull Request","title":"Pull Request","hpath":"dendron.dev.pull-request","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis goes into submitting a pull request\n\n## Commit Style\n\n- we follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with the following tags\n- categories:\n  -

They are written in a type script like pseudo code. The code blocks are broken down into the following structure:\n\n```\n# {Function}  --> what is happening\n## Summary    --> high level function call of what is happening\n## Flows      --> pseudo code describing high level functions\n\n### {Flow Entry}\n\n- loc: ... --> where code is located. {package}/{basename}\n- desc: ... --> description \n```\n\n## Pseudo Code\n\nThe code description is typescript-ish. The goal isn't to write valid typescript but be a **summarized** version of the code. The syntax is evolving but here is a loosely documented starting point:\n\n- @: equivalent of `this.`\n- $: referencing a global variable\n- `...`: code that is omitted because it would clutter the summary\n- `=:` magic equality, \n\nThe places where you see this convention being broken (eg. actual valid typescript) are areas where the author got lazy and just copied code into the summary. Try to not do this because that defeats the point of a _summarized_ view. That being said, Dendron is all about being pragmatic and taking an iterative approach to things. \n\n# Initializing the Engine\n\n## Summary\n\n- engine.query\n  - store.query\n    - FileParser.parse\n      ```ts\n      allFiles {\n        getFileMeta\n        toNode\n      }\n      ```\n    -

To debug the server: \n\n1. Launch the server using the build task `api-server:test launch server`\n2.

Run the following command to do so\n\n```\n./bootstrap/scripts/cleanup.sh\nyarn setup\n```\n\n### Install a new package\n\nBecause Dendron is packaged as a mono repo managed using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), you can't just do a regular `yarn add` to install new packages. This is because lerna symlinks mono-repo dependencies together and a `yarn add` would override that. Instead, use the following command:\n\n```\nlerna add {package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\nBecause this is typescript, don't forget to also install the `@types` package if it exists\n\n```bash\nlerna add @types/{package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\n- NOTE: watch out that you are installing dependencies in the right package. Missing dependencies will appear to work in development if that dependency is present in any of the other packages. The reason things work is because of the way the nodejs module resolution works and that we're in a monorepo. Dependencies are installed at the root of the monorepo and will be found there when the package doesn't have them. When we publish them as npm packages, these dependencies will show up as missing in their respective packages if its not included in the dependencies\n\n### Add a new node package\n\n- initialize repo\n\n```bash\ncd {workspace_dir}\ncp -R /path/to/dendron-yeoman/node-ts packages/{new-package}\n```\n\n- update `package.json`\n\n  - change project name\n\n- publish the repo (needs to be done initially before running lerna publish)\n\n```\nnpm publish --access public\n```\n\n### Using eslint\n\nAll packages in the repo use a standard base configuration found at [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js). If you're using the VS Code and would like to see eslint violations on it, install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).\n\n### Add a new site config option\n\nThe following is an example of controlling formatting options to the DendronSiteConfig. You can see the [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/278) for more details.\n\nDendron currently will auto-format notes during `Rename` and `Refactor` operations when links inside a note need to be replaced.\n\nThe formatting options are defined [here](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#renaming-a-note).\n\nThese are [rough notes](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#flow) of how formatting gets called during rename\n\nTo make this customizable, the following changes need to be made:\n\n- [ ] update the [DendronConfig type definition](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L405:L405)\n- [ ] update [config defaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/config.ts#L42:L42)\n- [ ] pass in formatting options from the [plugin](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/RenameNoteV2a.ts#L137:L137)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [server](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/api-server/src/routes/note.ts#L38:L38)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [engine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/enginev2.ts#L249:L249)\n- [ ] accept it when [replacing links](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L85:L85)\n- [ ] accept it in [remark pipeline](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L41:L41)\n\nWhen all this is done, we can add tests that the formatting behavior works\n\n- [ ] [engine tests](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/__tests__/enginev2.spec.ts#L652:L652)\n- [ ] [plugin test](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L157:L157)\n\nThe above changes are for `Rename`. `Refactor` calls rename in a loop so changing rename should update refactor as well.\n\n### Using a local registry\n\n- pre-req:\n  - install verdaccio\n\n```sh\nsource bootstrap/scripts/helpers.sh\nsetRegLocal\nverdaccio\n```\n\n### Publishing\n\nThis will publish a patch release\n\n```\n./bootstrap/scripts/createBuild.sh\n```\n\n### Tuning Lookup\n- create `proto.ts` inside `engine-server`\n\n```ts\nimport { DNodeUtils, NoteProps, NoteUtils } from \"@dendronhq/common-all\";\nimport { getDurationMilliseconds } from \"@dendronhq/common-server\";\nimport fs from \"fs-extra\";\nimport Fuse from \"fuse.js\";\nimport _ from \"lodash\";\nimport { DendronEngineClient } from \"engineClient\";\n\nexport async function main2() {\n    const engine = DendronEngineClient.create({\n        port: \"3005\",\n        ws: \"/Users/kevinlin/code/dendron/test-workspace\",\n        vaults: []\n      });\n       await engine.init();\n    //   const notes = data?.notes!\n      const notes: NoteProps[] = [NoteUtils.create({fname: \"notes.dendron-improvements\", vault: engine.vaults[0]})]\n\n    const initList: any[] = [];\n    const options = {\n        shouldSort: true,\n        threshold: 0.6,\n        location: 0,\n        distance: 50,\n        maxPatternLength: 32,\n        minMatchCharLength: 2,\n        keys: [\"fname\"],\n        useExtendedSearch: true,\n        includeScore: true,\n      };\n      const fuse = new Fuse(initList, options);\n      fuse.setCollection(\n        _.map(notes, ({ fname, title, id, vault }, _key) => ({\n          fname,\n          id,\n          title,\n          vault,\n        }))\n      );\n      const qs = \"dendron.notes\"\n      const resp = fuse.search(qs)\n      const numResults = _.size(notes);\n      const numHits = _.size(resp);\n      const stats = {numResults, numHits};\n      console.log(stats);\n}\n\nexport async function main() {\n  let start = process.hrtime();\n  const engine = DendronEngineClient.create({\n    port: \"3005\",\n    ws: \"/Users/kevinlin/Dropbox/Apps/Noah\",\n    vaults: [],\n  });\n  let engineCreate = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n  const wsRoot = engine.wsRoot;\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  await engine.init();\n  let engineInit = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  await engine.queryNotes({ qs: \"*\" });\n  let engineStarQuery = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  let resp = await engine.queryNotes({ qs: \"pr\" });\n  let engineDomainQuery = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n  let nodes = resp.data;\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  resp = await engine.queryNotes({ qs: \"cli.git\" });\n  let engineDomainWithChildQuery = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n  nodes = resp.data;\n  const numProps = nodes.length;\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  await Promise.all(\n    nodes.map(async (ent) =>\n      DNodeUtils.enhancePropForQuickInput({\n        wsRoot,\n        props: ent,\n        schemas: engine.schemas,\n        vaults: engine.vaults,\n      })\n    )\n  );\n  let enhancePropsWithPromise = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  await Promise.all(\n    nodes.slice(0, 100).map(async (ent) =>\n      DNodeUtils.enhancePropForQuickInput({\n        wsRoot,\n        props: ent,\n        schemas: engine.schemas,\n        vaults: engine.vaults,\n      })\n    )\n  );\n  let enhancePropsWithPromise100 = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  await Promise.all(\n    nodes.slice(0, 50).map(async (ent) =>\n      DNodeUtils.enhancePropForQuickInput({\n        wsRoot,\n        props: ent,\n        schemas: engine.schemas,\n        vaults: engine.vaults,\n      })\n    )\n  );\n  let enhancePropsWithPromise50 = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  start = process.hrtime();\n  nodes.slice(0, 50).map((ent) =>\n    DNodeUtils.enhancePropForQuickInput({\n      wsRoot,\n      props: ent,\n      schemas: engine.schemas,\n      vaults: engine.vaults,\n    })\n  );\n  let enhancePropsNoPromise50 = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\n\n  const out = {\n    engineCreate,\n    engineInit,\n    engineStarQuery,\n    engineDomainQuery,\n    engineDomainWithChildQuery,\n    numProps,\n    enhancePropsWithPromise,\n    enhancePropsWithPromise100,\n    enhancePropsWithPromise50,\n    enhancePropsNoPromise50,\n  };\n  console.log(out);\n  fs.writeJSONSync(\"/tmp/data.json\", out, { spaces: 4 });\n  return;\n}\nmain2();\n```\n\n### Manually Formatting the code\n\nFrom the root workspace, you can run `yarn format` to run `prettier` on all packages. This should be unecessary since we auto format on every commit\n\n\n### Git Ignore Blame\n\nIn case of large refactorign changes, we want to not overwrite authorship and commit history. \n\nIn the project root, run the following after you have commited your styling changes to preserve the history.\n\n```sh\necho $HASH_OF_COMMIT >> .git-blame-ignore-revs\n```\n\nYou can see an explanation of how it works [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt)\n\n### Adding a new configuration property\n\n![[dendron://dendron-site/pkg.dendron-plugin.cook#adding-a-new-config,1:#*]]","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html","relUrl":"notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html"},{"doc":"API","title":"API","hpath":"dendron.dev.api","content":"\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html","relUrl":"notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html"},{"doc":"Contribute","title":"Contribute","hpath":"dendron.contribute","content":"## Table of Contents\n\n## Development\n\n\n![[dendron.contribute.dev#summary,1:#*]]\n\n### First Time Developers\n\n![[dendron.contribute.first-dev]]\n\n## Documentation\n\n![[dendron.contribute.documentation#summary,1:#*]]\n\n## Financially\n\n![[dendron.contribute.financial]]\n\n## Spread the word! \n\n![[dendron.contribute.spread-the-word]]","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/125c990b-6fe7-4ada-a65f-44cbde8b33f0.html","relUrl":"notes/125c990b-6fe7-4ada-a65f-44cbde8b33f0.html"},{"doc":"Spread the Word!","title":"Spread the Word!","hpath":"dendron.contribute.spread-the-word","content":"\nIf Dendron has been useful, we’d appreciate it if you help us spread the word.

Note that features with 🚧 are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.\n\n### Markdown\n\nDendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). \n\nYou can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here|dendron.topic.frontmatter]]\n\n### Workspace\n\n![[dendron.ref.workspace#summary,1]]\n\n### Vaults\n\n![[dendron.ref.vaults#summary,1:#*]]\n\n### Hierarchies\n\n![[dendron.topic.hierarchies#Summary,1:#concepts]]\n\nYou can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]\n\n### Domain\n\nA domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\n### Schema\n\nAs you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. \n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. \n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\n### Stubs\n\nStubs are notes that don't exist but that you might want to create. They will show up as suggestions in lookup results.\nThere are two reasons why these suggested notes might show up: \n\n- they are the uncreated parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)\n- they are possible notes according to the schema\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist \n\n### Pods\n\n[[Pods|dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n### Command Palette\n\nThe command palette is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command palette.\n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n### Lookup Bar\n\nThe lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron.

A reporter asked Einstein about the value of some physical constant and Einstein replied that he didn't know. The reporter was flabbergasted but Einstein replied that he didn't want to bother memorizing something that he could easily look up.\n\nThis anecdote has always stuck with me because we live in a world where **everything** can be \"looked up.” In such a world, what does it even mean to know something? And how do you apply that knowledge when there's just so much of it?\n\nIt was trying to answer these questions that led me to experiment and ultimately built my [own system for note-taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html). Much like ML, the insight I had is that general knowledge, once cleaned up and structured, becomes orders of magnitude more useful.\n\nA year ago, I launched [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) to see if this system I developed would work for anyone else - now 3000 commits and 27,000 downloads later, I'm happy to say that it does. I get a thrill every time someone messages me about how they're using Dendron - whether it's planning out their next Dungeons and Dragons game or it's using Dendron as the central knowledge base for both work and home.\n\nWhat makes Dendron powerful is our ability to let users organize their information in a way that's most useful to them. Dendron takes many of the affordances developers are used to in code, like abstractions ([note references](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html)), [refactoring](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#refactor-hierarchy), and [symbol lookup](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) and applying it to general knowledge.\n\nThese capabilities combined with our model of working over plaintext markdown and our open source license means that your knowledge is always yours, available instantly and in any way you want it.\n\nMoving forward, we will further expand on Dendron's capabilities to make it a full-blown **IDE for general knowledge.** To pursue this goal, we've raised [$2 million in seed capital](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/take-note-amazon-vets-raise-2m-dendron-tool-manage-large-amounts-information/) from [FUSE](https://fuse.vc/), [Founders’ Co-Op](https://www.founderscoop.com/), [First Rays](https://www.firstraysvc.com/), [Altair Capital](https://www.altair-cap.com/) and some incredible angels to build up our team. This money will ensure that issues and bugs can be addressed on time and take on more ambitious features.\n\nRest assured that nothing is changing about the way we do things - Dendron will remain open source and the client will always be local first and free. We plan to make money by charging teams and enterprises who want access to additional features like single sign-on, private registries and fine-grained access control.\n\nAs part of our growth from a project to a company, we are also publishing the [Dendron Handbook](https://handbook.dendron.so/). This is **heavily inspired** from the [Gitlab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and will document our mission, values, and roadmap as a company.\n\nFrom day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star\n\n> \"We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945\n\nOur goal is to help humans take **command over the inherited knowledge of the ages**. We welcome you to be part of our journey :)\n\n(and we are [[hiring|dendron.jobs]])\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8d6bb6c6-f2b5-4fb4-a7f0-1930b528051f.html","relUrl":"notes/8d6bb6c6-f2b5-4fb4-a7f0-1930b528051f.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Alternatives","title":"Dendron Alternatives","hpath":"dendron.alternatives","content":"\nThe main difference between Dendron and almost every other note taking tool can be summed up below.
